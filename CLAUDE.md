# Peach - Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow

- Commit changes after each meaningful task completion (e.g., story created, sprint status updated, code implemented)
- Use descriptive commit messages that reference the story or task context
- Do not batch unrelated changes into a single commit
- Do not push to remote unless explicitly asked
