# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Michael
**Date:** 2026-02-11

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Core requirements for an iOS pitch discrimination ear training app for musicians
**Goals:** Discover and document essential requirements — what the app must do, who it serves, and what makes it effective for training fine pitch perception

### Context Guidance

_No external context file provided._

### Session Setup

**Target Users:** Musicians (singers, string, woodwind, brass players) for whom intonation is a practical challenge. The app trains the foundational skill underneath good intonation — the ability to precisely hear and distinguish pitches. It is a training tool for pitch discrimination, not a performance or production tool.
