# 8. Crosscutting Concepts

## Dependency Injection

All services are created in `PeachApp.init()` (composition root) and injected into the view hierarchy via SwiftUI `@Environment`:

```swift
// PeachApp.swift — composition root
ContentView()
    .environment(\.comparisonSession, comparisonSession)
    .environment(\.pitchMatchingSession, pitchMatchingSession)
    .environment(\.perceptualProfile, profile)
    .environment(\.trendAnalyzer, trendAnalyzer)
    .environment(\.thresholdTimeline, thresholdTimeline)
    .environment(\.soundFontLibrary, soundFontLibrary)
    .modelContainer(modelContainer)
```

All `@Entry` environment key definitions are consolidated in `App/EnvironmentKeys.swift`:

```swift
extension EnvironmentValues {
    @Entry var soundFontLibrary = SoundFontLibrary()
    @Entry var trendAnalyzer = TrendAnalyzer()
    @Entry var thresholdTimeline = ThresholdTimeline()
    @Entry var activeSession: (any TrainingSession)? = nil
    @Entry var perceptualProfile = PerceptualProfile()
    @Entry var comparisonSession: ComparisonSession = { ... }()
    @Entry var pitchMatchingSession: PitchMatchingSession = { ... }()
}
```

The `@Entry` macro replaces manual `EnvironmentKey` structs — no boilerplate `defaultValue` or computed property needed. This consolidation keeps Core/ free of SwiftUI imports.

Views consume services via `@Environment(\.comparisonSession)`. Tests inject mocks directly into session initializers — no environment needed.

## Concurrency Model

**`@MainActor` everywhere UI-facing.** All service classes, all mocks, all test functions are `@MainActor`. The compiler enforces isolation boundaries — there is no manual thread management.

**`async/await` only.** No completion handlers, no Combine, no `DispatchQueue`. Asynchronous work uses structured concurrency with `Task`s that are stored for cancellation.

**`Sendable` at boundaries.** Value types (`Comparison`, `CompletedComparison`, `TrainingSettings`, `PerceptualNote`) are `Sendable` by construction. Reference types stay on `@MainActor`.

## Observer Pattern

`ComparisonObserver` decouples `ComparisonSession` from its side-effect handlers:

```swift
protocol ComparisonObserver {
    func comparisonCompleted(_ completed: CompletedComparison)
}
```

Five comparison observers are wired in `PeachApp.init()`:

| Observer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `TrainingDataStore` | Persist the `ComparisonRecord` to SwiftData |
| `PerceptualProfile` | Update per-note statistics (Welford's) |
| `HapticFeedbackManager` | Trigger haptic feedback on wrong answer |
| `TrendAnalyzer` | Update improving/stable/declining trend |
| `ThresholdTimeline` | Track threshold history for timeline visualization |

`PitchMatchingObserver` follows the same pattern for `PitchMatchingSession`:

```swift
protocol PitchMatchingObserver {
    func pitchMatchingCompleted(_ completed: CompletedPitchMatching)
}
```

Pitch matching observers (e.g., `TrainingDataStore`, `PerceptualProfile`) are wired separately in `PeachApp.init()`.

Each observer handles its own errors internally. A failure in one observer does not affect the others or the training loop.

## Error Handling Strategy

**Typed error enums per service:**
- `AudioError` — `engineStartFailed`, `nodeAttachFailed`, `renderFailed`, `invalidFrequency`, `contextUnavailable`
- `DataStoreError` — `saveFailed`, `fetchFailed`, `deleteFailed`

**TrainingSession as error boundary:**
- Audio errors → stop training silently (transition to idle)
- Data write errors → log internally, continue training (one lost record is acceptable)
- The user never sees an error screen during training

**Observer error isolation:**
- Each `ComparisonObserver` catches its own errors
- `TrainingDataStore.comparisonCompleted()` wraps `save()` in do/catch
- A failed observer does not block other observers or the training loop

## Testing Approach

**Protocol-based mocking.** Every service has a protocol. Tests inject mocks that conform to the same protocol:

```swift
// Production
ComparisonSession(notePlayer: SoundFontNotePlayer(), strategy: KazezNoteStrategy(), ...)

// Test
ComparisonSession(notePlayer: MockNotePlayer(), strategy: MockNextComparisonStrategy(), ...)
```

**Mock contract (all mocks must provide):**
- Call tracking: `playCallCount`, `lastFrequency`, `playHistory`
- Error injection: `shouldThrowError`, `errorToThrow`
- Synchronous callbacks: `onPlayCalled`, `onStopCalled`
- `instantPlayback` mode for deterministic timing
- `reset()` method for cleanup

**Async testing pattern:**
```swift
@Test("plays note 1 after starting")
func playsNote1AfterStarting() async {
    let (session, notePlayer, _) = makeComparisonSession()
    session.start()
    try await waitForState(session, expected: .playingNote1)
    #expect(notePlayer.playCallCount == 1)
}
```

`waitForState` polls the session's state with a timeout — never use raw `#expect` immediately after an async action. Test functions are `async` (no explicit `@MainActor` needed — default isolation applies).

**SwiftData in tests:** Always `ModelConfiguration(isStoredInMemoryOnly: true)`. Never use the production container.

## Data Integrity

- SwiftData atomic writes backed by SQLite — no partial `ComparisonRecord`s
- Only complete comparison results are written (after user answers)
- Incomplete comparisons (interrupted by navigation, phone call, backgrounding) are discarded entirely
- `TrainingDataStore` is the sole writer — no concurrent access to `ModelContext`

## Localization

- String Catalogs (`Localizable.xcstrings`) for English and German
- SwiftUI native `Text("key")` localization
- All user-facing strings are localized; technical terms in logs/comments stay in English

## Accessibility

- All interactive controls labeled for VoiceOver
- Tap targets ≥ 44×44pt (Apple HIG)
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Haptic feedback as non-visual complement to the feedback indicator
- `@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass)` for responsive layout (compact vs. regular)
