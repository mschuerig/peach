## Story

As a **musician using Peach**,
I want to see my pitch discrimination progress as a threshold convergence chart over time,
So that I can see meaningful evidence that training is working, reflecting that pitch discrimination is one unified skill rather than many per-note skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the Profile Screen with training data
   **When** it is displayed
   **Then** it shows a time-series chart where:
   - The X-axis represents time (aggregated by period, default: day)
   - The Y-axis represents detection threshold in cents (lower = better)
   - Aggregated period data points appear as small dots (one per day, showing mean threshold for that day)
   - A rolling mean line shows the overall trend across aggregated periods
   - A rolling standard deviation band surrounds the mean line
   - The aggregation period is internally parameterized (default: `.day`, configurable to `.hour`, `.weekOfYear`, etc.)
   **And** the per-note confidence band and piano keyboard are removed from the Profile Screen

2. **Given** the time-series chart with more data than fits on screen
   **When** the user swipes horizontally
   **Then** the chart scrolls to reveal earlier or later data
   **And** the chart defaults to showing the most recent data (right edge)

3. **Given** the time-series chart
   **When** the user pinches to zoom
   **Then** the time axis scales (expanding or compressing the visible time range)
   **And** the chart remains scrollable after zooming

4. **Given** the time-series chart with aggregated data points
   **When** the user taps on or near a data point
   **Then** a popup appears showing:
   - The date of the aggregated period
   - The mean threshold for that period (in cents)
   - The number of comparisons in that period
   - The accuracy (correct count out of total)
   **And** the popup dismisses when the user taps elsewhere

5. **Given** the Profile Screen with no training data (cold start)
   **When** it is displayed
   **Then** the chart area shows an empty state
   **And** the text "Start training to build your profile" appears

6. **Given** the Start Screen
   **When** the Profile Preview is displayed with training data
   **Then** it shows a simplified sparkline of the rolling mean (no dots, no labels, no axes)
   **And** the piano keyboard is removed from the preview
   **And** it remains tappable to navigate to the full Profile Screen

7. **Given** SummaryStatisticsView on the Profile Screen
   **When** displayed with training data
   **Then** it continues to show overall mean, standard deviation, and trend indicator
   **And** its behavior is unchanged from the current implementation

8. **Given** the full test suite
   **When** all tests are run
   **Then** all tests pass
   **And** new tests verify timeline data preparation, rolling statistics computation, and interaction behavior
   **And** removed visualization tests (confidence band, piano keyboard) are cleaned up

## Dev Notes

### Background and Rationale

Story 9.1 established that pitch discrimination is one unified skill with a roughly uniform threshold across the frequency range (Hawkey et al. 2004, Irvine et al. 2000). KazezNoteStrategy is now the default, using a single continuous difficulty chain with random note selection.

The current Profile Screen shows a **per-note confidence band over a piano keyboard** — this visualization implies that per-note differences are meaningful, when in reality they are mostly data collection artifacts. A **threshold convergence chart over time** is:
- More honest: shows the one thing that actually changes (overall threshold)
- More motivating: the user sees a line trending downward over days/weeks
- More scientifically sound: aligned with perceptual learning literature

See `docs/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-2026-02-24.md` for the full research basis.

### Technical Requirements

**ThresholdTimeline service pattern:**
- Follows the exact same pattern as `PerceptualProfile` and `TrendAnalyzer`: `@Observable @MainActor final class`, conforms to `ComparisonObserver`, loaded from `ComparisonRecord` array at startup, updated incrementally
- Stores `[TimelineDataPoint]` sorted chronologically — each point holds timestamp, `abs(note2CentOffset)`, isCorrect, note1 MIDI number
- Rolling statistics use a sliding window (default 20 comparisons). For < 20 points, use expanding window (all available data)
- Rolling mean: arithmetic mean of centDifference over window
- Rolling stdDev: sample standard deviation over window (returns 0 for window size 1)

**Chart rendering with Swift Charts:**
- Three chart layers rendered in order (back to front): AreaMark (stddev band) → LineMark (rolling mean) → PointMark (individual dots)
- Use `.chartScrollableAxes(.horizontal)` for native horizontal scrolling
- Use `.chartXVisibleDomain(length:)` to set initial visible range — suggest last ~100 comparisons or last 7 days, whichever is smaller
- `MagnifyGesture` modifies the visible domain length via `@State` scale factor
- `.chartOverlay` with `SpatialTapGesture` for point selection; use `proxy.value(atX:as:)` to map tap location to `Date`, then find nearest point

**Detail popup:**
- Anchored near the tapped point, not centered on screen
- Shows: formatted timestamp (`DateFormatter` with date+time), note name from MIDI (use existing note name logic or `FrequencyCalculation`), cent difference formatted as `"X.X cents"`, correct/incorrect with SF Symbol (checkmark/xmark)
- Styled with `.background(.regularMaterial)` and rounded corners — stock SwiftUI
- Dismissed by tapping outside or tapping the chart again

**What stays unchanged:**
- `PerceptualProfile` — still collects per-note data, still provides `overallMean` for KazezNoteStrategy cold start
- `TrendAnalyzer` — still provides the trend arrow for `SummaryStatisticsView`
- `SummaryStatisticsView` — same three stats (mean, stddev, trend), same computation from `PerceptualProfile`
- `TrainingSession` — no changes needed
- `ComparisonRecord` — no schema changes; timestamp field already provides the X-axis data

### Architecture Compliance

- **New service follows observer pattern**: `ThresholdTimeline` conforms to `ComparisonObserver`, same as `PerceptualProfile` and `TrendAnalyzer`. Added to observer array in `PeachApp.swift`. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "Observer pattern"]
- **Composition root**: `ThresholdTimeline` instantiated in `PeachApp.swift`, injected via `@Environment` with custom `EnvironmentKey`. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "Composition Root"]
- **Views only interact with services via environment**: `ProfileScreen` reads `ThresholdTimeline` from environment, never accesses `TrainingDataStore` directly. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "Views are thin"]
- **Protocol boundary preserved**: `ThresholdTimeline` receives data through `ComparisonObserver` protocol, doesn't directly query `TrainingDataStore`. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "TrainingDataStore is the sole data accessor"]
- **@Observable, not ObservableObject**: `ThresholdTimeline` uses `@Observable` macro. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "Never Do This"]

### Library & Framework Requirements

- **Swift Charts** (first-party, already in use) — `PointMark`, `LineMark`, `AreaMark`, `.chartScrollableAxes`, `.chartXVisibleDomain`, `.chartOverlay`
- **SwiftUI `MagnifyGesture`** (first-party) — for pinch-to-zoom
- **No new dependencies** — all capabilities are first-party iOS 26 frameworks

### File Structure Requirements

**New files:**
```
Peach/Core/Profile/ThresholdTimeline.swift              # Service: timeline data + rolling stats
Peach/Profile/ThresholdTimelineView.swift                # View: time-series chart with scroll/zoom/tap
PeachTests/Core/Profile/ThresholdTimelineTests.swift     # Tests: rolling stats, loading, incremental update
```

**Modified files:**
```
Peach/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift                        # Replace visualization, update layout + accessibility
Peach/Start/ProfilePreviewView.swift                     # Replace with sparkline
Peach/App/PeachApp.swift                                 # Wire ThresholdTimeline as observer + environment
Peach/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings                    # New strings, remove unused
```

**Deleted files:**
```
Peach/Profile/ConfidenceBandView.swift                   # Replaced by ThresholdTimelineView
Peach/Profile/PianoKeyboardView.swift                    # No longer used
PeachTests/Profile/ConfidenceBandDataTests.swift         # Tests for removed component (if exists)
PeachTests/Profile/PianoKeyboardLayoutTests.swift        # Tests for removed component (if exists)
```

### Testing Requirements

- **New tests** (`ThresholdTimelineTests.swift`):
  - Rolling mean with exact window: verify correct arithmetic mean over sliding window
  - Rolling stddev with exact window: verify sample standard deviation
  - Expanding window for < windowSize points: verify all available points used
  - Empty state: verify nil/empty returns
  - Single point: verify mean = that point, stddev = 0
  - Incremental update via `ComparisonObserver`: verify new point appended and rolling stats updated
  - Load from `ComparisonRecord` array: verify chronological ordering preserved, centDifference = abs(offset)
- **Removed tests**: Delete test files for `ConfidenceBandData` and `PianoKeyboardLayout`
- **Updated tests**: `ProfileScreen` layout tests (if any) — update for new chart component
- **Unchanged tests**: `PerceptualProfileTests`, `TrendAnalyzerTests`, `SummaryStatisticsViewTests`, `TrainingSessionTests`, all algorithm tests
- **All tests `@MainActor async`** per project testing rules
- **Struct-based test suites** with factory methods, no `setUp/tearDown`

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From story 9.1 (most recent, same epic):**
- `PeachApp.swift` wires services in `init()` — this is where `ThresholdTimeline` gets added to the observer array and injected into the environment
- `ComparisonObserver` protocol pattern is established — `PerceptualProfile` and `TrendAnalyzer` both conform; `ThresholdTimeline` follows the same pattern
- `PerceptualProfile.overallMean` is used by `KazezNoteStrategy` for cold start — must not be disrupted
- `TrendAnalyzer` provides `Trend` enum to `SummaryStatisticsView` — stays as-is
- The brainstorming session (`docs/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-2026-02-24.md`) provides the research rationale for this entire epic

**From story 5.1 (original profile visualization):**
- `ProfileScreen` currently uses `ConfidenceBandView` + `PianoKeyboardView` — both being replaced
- `ConfidenceBandData.prepare(from:midiRange:)` computes per-note data points — no longer needed
- `SummaryStatisticsView.computeStats(from:midiRange:)` computes mean/stddev from per-note profile — this stays
- Layout methods `confidenceBandMinHeight()` and `keyboardHeight()` — replaced by timeline chart sizing
- `PerceptualProfileKey` environment key defined in `ProfileScreen.swift` — stays (still used for SummaryStatisticsView)

**From story 5.3 (profile preview):**
- `ProfilePreviewView` reuses the same data pipeline as `ProfileScreen` — will now reuse `ThresholdTimeline` instead
- Preview height ~45pt with keyboard ~25pt — new sparkline can use full ~70pt or stay at 45pt
- `NavigationLink` wrapper — stays unchanged
- Accessibility: "Your pitch profile. Tap to view details." — update wording to "Your training progress."

### Git Intelligence

Recent commits show clean patterns:
- Story 9.1 (`0c06be0`, `855f825`): Modified `PeachApp.swift` for strategy swap, clean one-line changes in composition root
- Story 8.3 (`4391637`): Removed `SineWaveNotePlayer` and `RoutingNotePlayer` — established pattern for cleanly removing unused components and their tests
- All commits follow: implement → code review findings → next story
- Test suite consistently passes before each commit

### Project Structure Notes

- `ThresholdTimeline.swift` goes in `Core/Profile/` alongside `PerceptualProfile.swift` and `TrendAnalyzer.swift` — same domain
- `ThresholdTimelineView.swift` goes in `Profile/` alongside `ProfileScreen.swift` and `SummaryStatisticsView.swift` — same feature
- Tests mirror source: `PeachTests/Core/Profile/ThresholdTimelineTests.swift`
- Deletion of `ConfidenceBandView.swift` and `PianoKeyboardView.swift` follows the precedent set in story 8.3 (removing unused components cleanly)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.6 (claude-opus-4-6)

### Debug Log References

- Fixed `chartScrollPosition(initialX:)` build error: `Date?` needed nil coalescing `?? Date()` for non-optional parameter
- Fixed 2 test failures in `ProfileScreenLayoutTests`: `String(localized:)` returns German on German-locale simulator; replaced locale-dependent assertions (`contains("timeline")`) with locale-independent ones (`contains("30")`, `contains("50")`)

### Completion Notes List

- `PianoKeyboardLayout` kept in `PianoKeyboardView.swift` — still used by Settings
- `PerceptualProfile` and its environment key remain — still used by `SummaryStatisticsView` and `KazezNoteStrategy` for cold start
- `TrainingSession.swift` modified to accept optional `ThresholdTimeline` and call `reset()` in `resetTrainingData()` — not explicitly in story tasks but needed for data reset flow
- Old localization strings marked `"extractionState": "stale"` rather than deleted — Xcode manages cleanup
- 20 new unit tests in `ThresholdTimelineTests.swift`; 2 updated tests in `ProfileScreenLayoutTests.swift`; updated tests in `ProfilePreviewViewTests.swift`
- **Rework notes:** Added `AggregatedDataPoint` and `aggregationComponent: Calendar.Component` (default `.day`) to `ThresholdTimeline`. Rolling mean/stddev now operate on aggregated period points, not individual comparisons. Chart PointMark shows one dot per aggregated period. Tap popup shows day summary. Detail popup no longer shows `PianoKeyboardLayout.noteName()` (aggregated across many notes). Tests rewritten to use day-spaced data with new aggregation-specific tests (28 total). Preview data updated to use day-spaced records.

### Change Log

- Replaced per-note confidence band + piano keyboard visualization with threshold convergence time-series chart
- Added `ThresholdTimeline` service following observer pattern (ComparisonObserver, EnvironmentKey, composition root wiring)
- Added `ThresholdTimelineView` with Swift Charts: AreaMark (stddev band), LineMark (rolling mean), PointMark (individual dots)
- Added horizontal scrolling, pinch-to-zoom (MagnifyGesture), and tap-for-details popup
- Updated `ProfilePreviewView` with sparkline chart (rolling mean LineMark only)
- Deleted `ConfidenceBandView.swift` and `PianoKeyboardView` struct
- Updated accessibility summaries for Profile Screen and Profile Preview
- Added German translations for all new strings
- **Rework:** Added `AggregatedDataPoint` struct and `aggregationComponent` parameter (default: `.day`) to `ThresholdTimeline`
- **Rework:** Chart now shows aggregated period dots instead of individual comparisons; rolling stats computed over aggregated periods
- **Rework:** Tap popup now shows day summary (date, mean threshold, comparison count, accuracy) instead of individual comparison details
- **Rework:** Updated all tests to use day-spaced data; added aggregation-specific tests (same-day grouping, absolute values, correct counts, hourly aggregation, chronological ordering)
