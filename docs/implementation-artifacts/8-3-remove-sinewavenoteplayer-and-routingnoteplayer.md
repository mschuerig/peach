# Story 8.3: Remove SineWaveNotePlayer and RoutingNotePlayer

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **developer maintaining Peach**,
I want to remove `SineWaveNotePlayer` and `RoutingNotePlayer` in favor of `SoundFontNotePlayer` as the sole `NotePlayer` implementation,
So that the audio subsystem has a single code path, fewer moving parts, and no dead fallback code.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the codebase after this story
   **When** I search for `SineWaveNotePlayer`
   **Then** no production code references it
   **And** `Peach/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayer.swift` has been deleted

2. **Given** the codebase after this story
   **When** I search for `RoutingNotePlayer`
   **Then** no production code references it
   **And** `Peach/Core/Audio/RoutingNotePlayer.swift` has been deleted

3. **Given** `SoundFontNotePlayer` as the sole `NotePlayer` implementation
   **When** `play(frequency:duration:amplitude:)` is called
   **Then** it reads the current `soundSource` from `UserDefaults` (key: `SettingsKeys.soundSource`)
   **And** parses the `"sf2:{bank}:{program}"` tag to determine the target preset
   **And** calls `loadPreset(program:bank:)` if the preset differs from the currently loaded one
   **And** plays the note using the selected preset
   **And** if the tag is unparseable or the preset load fails, it falls back to the default sound source (`sf2:8:80`)

4. **Given** `SettingsKeys.defaultSoundSource`
   **When** the app is launched for the first time (no stored preference)
   **Then** the default sound source is `"sf2:8:80"` (SF2 Sine Wave preset)

5. **Given** an existing user whose stored `soundSource` is `"sine"`
   **When** the Settings Screen appears
   **Then** the value is migrated to `"sf2:8:80"` and persisted

6. **Given** the Settings Screen instrument picker
   **When** displayed
   **Then** it shows only SF2 presets from `SoundFontLibrary.availablePresets`
   **And** there is no separate hardcoded "Sine Wave" entry (the SF2 "Sine Wave" preset at `sf2:8:80` appears naturally in the alphabetically sorted list)
   **And** the currently selected preset is visually indicated

7. **Given** `PeachApp.swift`
   **When** the app initializes
   **Then** it creates only a `SoundFontNotePlayer` (no `SineWaveNotePlayer`, no `RoutingNotePlayer`)
   **And** passes it directly as the `NotePlayer` to `TrainingSession`

8. **Given** the `NotePlayer` protocol and `AudioError` enum
   **When** reviewed after this story
   **Then** the `public` access modifier is removed (changed to `internal`) since all conformers are now internal
   **And** the protocol doc comments no longer reference `SineWaveNotePlayer`

9. **Given** the test suite
   **When** all tests are run
   **Then** `SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift` and `SineWaveNotePlayerPlaybackTests.swift` have been deleted
   **And** `RoutingNotePlayerTests.swift` has been deleted
   **And** any `FrequencyCalculation` tests that lived in `SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift` have been relocated (not lost)
   **And** `SoundFontNotePlayerTests` covers the absorbed preset-selection-from-UserDefaults logic
   **And** the full remaining test suite passes

10. **Given** `docs/project-context.md`
    **When** reviewed after this story
    **Then** it no longer references `SineWaveNotePlayer` or `RoutingNotePlayer`
    **And** the audio architecture section describes `SoundFontNotePlayer` as the sole `NotePlayer` implementation
    **And** the `soundSource` tag format documentation is updated (no more `"sine"` tag)

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Technical Requirements

- **Preset routing absorption**: The key behavior from `RoutingNotePlayer` that moves into `SoundFontNotePlayer.play()` is: (1) read `UserDefaults` for `soundSource`, (2) parse the `"sf2:{bank}:{program}"` tag, (3) call `loadPreset` if preset changed. This is ~15 lines of logic. The `parseSF2Tag` helper can be moved as-is.

- **No more fallback to sine**: If `SoundFontNotePlayer` init fails, the app cannot play notes at all. This is acceptable because: (a) the SF2 file is bundled in the app — if it's missing, the app is corrupted; (b) `SineWaveNotePlayer` also used `AVAudioEngine`, so it would fail under the same conditions; (c) a non-functional fallback is worse than a clear failure.

- **Default preset**: The SF2 "Sine Wave" preset is at bank 8, program 80, tag `"sf2:8:80"`. This maintains behavioral continuity for new users — they still hear a sine wave by default.

- **Migration**: Users with `soundSource == "sine"` need migration to `"sf2:8:80"`. Users with `soundSource == "cello"` already migrate to `"sf2:0:42"` (from story 8.2). Both migrations should be handled.

- **AudioError cleanup**: With `SineWaveNotePlayer` gone, check if `renderFailed` and `nodeAttachFailed` are still used. If not, remove them — dead enum cases are dead code.

### Architecture Compliance

- **Single NotePlayer implementation**: `SoundFontNotePlayer` is the sole concrete `NotePlayer`. The protocol remains for testability (`MockNotePlayer` in tests). [Source: docs/project-context.md — "NotePlayer protocol"]
- **No `public` access**: All production types become `internal`. [Source: docs/project-context.md — "Never use public access"]
- **UserDefaults coupling**: `SoundFontNotePlayer` reading `UserDefaults` in `play()` matches the existing pattern from `RoutingNotePlayer`. The alternative (injecting a preset-selection dependency) would be over-engineering for a single setting read.

### Library & Framework Requirements

- No new dependencies. Net reduction in code.

### File Structure Requirements

**Deleted files:**
```
Peach/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayer.swift
Peach/Core/Audio/RoutingNotePlayer.swift
PeachTests/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift
PeachTests/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayerPlaybackTests.swift
PeachTests/Core/Audio/RoutingNotePlayerTests.swift
```

**Modified files:**
```
Peach/Core/Audio/SoundFontNotePlayer.swift    # Absorb preset routing logic
Peach/Core/Audio/NotePlayer.swift              # Remove public, clean up docs
Peach/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift            # Remove "Sine Wave" entry, update migration
Peach/Settings/SettingsKeys.swift              # Change default to "sf2:8:80"
Peach/App/PeachApp.swift                       # Simplify to single player
docs/project-context.md                        # Update architecture docs
```

**Potentially new file:**
```
PeachTests/Core/Audio/FrequencyCalculationTests.swift  # If relocating tests from deleted SineWaveNotePlayerTests
```

**Modified test files:**
```
PeachTests/Core/Audio/SoundFontNotePlayerTests.swift   # Add preset-routing tests
PeachTests/Settings/SettingsTests.swift                 # Update for new default, migration
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Relocated tests**: `FrequencyCalculation` tests currently in `SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift` must not be lost — relocate to a dedicated file or into `SoundFontNotePlayerTests`
- **New tests**: Verify `SoundFontNotePlayer.play()` reads UserDefaults and switches preset accordingly
- **Migration tests**: Verify `"sine"` → `"sf2:8:80"` migration in Settings
- **Default tests**: Verify new default sound source is `"sf2:8:80"`
- **All tests `@MainActor async`** per project testing rules

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From story 8-1:**
- `SoundFontNotePlayer` created with `AVAudioUnitSampler`, `loadPreset`, pitch bend, MIDI note-on/off
- `RoutingNotePlayer` created as the router between sine and SF2 — this story removes it
- `FrequencyCalculation.midiNoteAndCents()` — unchanged, still used by `SoundFontNotePlayer`

**From story 8-2:**
- `SoundFontLibrary` discovers presets, provides `availablePresets` for Settings UI — stays as-is
- `SettingsScreen` has instrument picker with "Sine Wave" hardcoded + dynamic SF2 list — this story removes the hardcoded entry
- `RoutingNotePlayer` parses `"sf2:{bank}:{program}"` tags — this logic moves into `SoundFontNotePlayer`
- `validatedSoundSource` binding falls back to `"sine"` — this story changes fallback to `"sf2:8:80"`

### Git Intelligence

This is a removal/simplification story. Net line count will decrease significantly (~300+ lines of production code, ~100+ lines of tests). Branch name: `8-3-remove-sinewavenoteplayer-and-routingnoteplayer`.

### Project Structure Notes

- No new directories needed
- Deleted files reduce the `Peach/Core/Audio/` directory from 7 files to 5
- Test directory similarly shrinks

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Notes

- Absorbed `RoutingNotePlayer.parseSF2Tag()` into `SoundFontNotePlayer` as a `static` method for testability
- Changed default preset from Cello (bank 0, program 42) to Sine Wave (bank 8, program 80) in SoundFontNotePlayer init
- Added UserDefaults soundSource reading at the start of `play()` — reads tag, parses it, and calls `loadPreset` if preset changed; falls back to default on parse failure or load error
- Relocated all FrequencyCalculation, AudioError, and Reference Pitch tests from `SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift` to `FrequencyCalculationTests.swift` — no tests lost
- Removed `AudioError.renderFailed` and `AudioError.nodeAttachFailed` (only used by deleted SineWaveNotePlayer); updated MockNotePlayer default error to `.engineStartFailed`
- Simplified `PeachApp.init()` from 3 players (SineWaveNotePlayer + SoundFontNotePlayer? + RoutingNotePlayer) to 1 (SoundFontNotePlayer)
- Settings migration handles "sine" → "sf2:8:80" and "cello" → "sf2:0:42"

### Completion Notes

All 8 tasks completed. All 10 acceptance criteria satisfied. Full test suite passes with zero failures. Net reduction in code: deleted 5 files (~500 lines of production code, ~400 lines of tests). Audio subsystem now has a single code path through SoundFontNotePlayer.
