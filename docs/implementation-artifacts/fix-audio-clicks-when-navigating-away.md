# Fix: Audio Clicks When Navigating Away During Playback

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **musician using Peach**,
I want audio to stop smoothly without clicks or pops when I navigate away from training,
so that the app feels polished and the abrupt audio artifacts don't distract or annoy me.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a note is playing during training, **When** the user navigates to Settings or Profile, **Then** audio fades out smoothly (no audible click/pop) before the player node stops
2. **Given** a note is playing during training, **When** the user answers during note 2 playback (early answer), **Then** audio fades out smoothly (no audible click/pop) before the player node stops
3. **Given** a note is playing during training, **When** the app is backgrounded, **Then** audio fades out smoothly (no audible click/pop) before the player node stops
4. **Given** a note is playing during training, **When** an audio interruption occurs (phone call, Siri), **Then** audio fades out smoothly (no audible click/pop) before the player node stops
5. **Given** no note is currently playing (state is `idle` or `awaitingAnswer`), **When** `stop()` is called, **Then** no audio artifact occurs and behavior is unchanged from current implementation
6. **Given** the fade-out implementation, **When** measured, **Then** the fade duration is <= 10ms (imperceptible delay, consistent with existing 5ms envelope constants)
7. **Given** all existing tests, **When** the full test suite runs, **Then** all tests pass (no regressions)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement fade-out in `SineWaveNotePlayer.stop()` (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6)
  - [ ] 1.1 Write failing test: stopping during playback should invoke fade-out (not abrupt stop)
  - [ ] 1.2 Modify `stop()` to schedule a short fade-out buffer (5-10ms linear ramp to zero) before calling `playerNode.stop()`
  - [ ] 1.3 Handle edge case: `stop()` called when nothing is playing (AC #5)
  - [ ] 1.4 Handle edge case: `stop()` called multiple times rapidly (idempotent)
  - [ ] 1.5 Ensure fade duration uses existing `releaseDuration` constant (5ms / 0.005s) for consistency
- [ ] Task 2: Verify all stop paths use the updated method (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4)
  - [ ] 2.1 Verify `TrainingSession.stop()` → `notePlayer.stop()` path (navigation away, backgrounding)
  - [ ] 2.2 Verify `TrainingSession.handleAnswer()` early-answer stop path
  - [ ] 2.3 Verify audio interruption handler stop path
- [ ] Task 3: Run full test suite and fix any regressions (AC: #7)
  - [ ] 3.1 Run `xcodebuild test -scheme Peach -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`
  - [ ] 3.2 Fix any failures related to timing changes in mock/test expectations

## Dev Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is in `SineWaveNotePlayer.stop()` (line 117-122 of `SineWaveNotePlayer.swift`):

```swift
public func stop() async throws {
    playerNode.stop()  // Abrupt truncation at current sample position
}
```

`AVAudioPlayerNode.stop()` immediately halts playback at the current sample. If the sine wave is not at a zero crossing, the instantaneous jump from a non-zero amplitude to silence creates a high-frequency transient — an audible click/pop.

### Recommended Fix Approach

**Schedule a short fade-out buffer before stopping the player node:**

1. Generate a tiny buffer (5ms = 221 samples at 44.1kHz) containing a linear ramp from current amplitude to zero
2. Schedule this buffer on the player node
3. Wait for it to complete (or use a brief delay)
4. Then call `playerNode.stop()`

**Key considerations:**
- Use existing `releaseDuration` constant (0.005s / 5ms) for the fade — matches the existing envelope design
- The fade buffer needs to start at the *current* amplitude of the playing waveform, but since we're using pre-rendered buffers, starting at amplitude 1.0 and ramping to 0.0 is sufficient (worst case: 5ms of slightly mismatched but inaudible fade)
- Alternative: Use `AVAudioMixerNode` volume ramp via `mainMixerNode.outputVolume` — simpler but affects global volume. **Prefer the buffer approach** as it's contained to the player node.
- `playerNode.stop()` cancels all scheduled buffers, so the fade buffer must use `playerNode.scheduleBuffer(fadeBuffer, at: nil, options: [])` and be awaited or timed before calling stop

**Simplest reliable approach:**
1. Set `mainMixerNode.outputVolume = 0` (instant, no scheduling needed)
2. Call `playerNode.stop()`
3. Reset `mainMixerNode.outputVolume = 1.0`

This is atomic and avoids buffer scheduling race conditions. The volume change to 0 silences the output before the abrupt stop, eliminating the click. Since this all happens within a single `stop()` call, the volume is restored before the next `play()`.

### Architecture Constraints

- **Single `SineWaveNotePlayer` instance** — created at app startup, injected everywhere [Source: docs/project-context.md#AVAudioEngine]
- **Protocol boundary: `NotePlayer`** — the `stop()` signature is `func stop() async throws`; no API change needed [Source: Peach/Core/Audio/NotePlayer.swift]
- **All stop paths go through `TrainingSession.stop()` or `handleAnswer()`** — no changes needed outside `SineWaveNotePlayer` [Source: Peach/Training/TrainingSession.swift:303-307, 245-250]
- **Swift 6 concurrency** — `SineWaveNotePlayer` is `@MainActor`; all audio operations are MainActor-isolated [Source: docs/project-context.md#Concurrency]

### Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Peach/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayer.swift` | Modify `stop()` to fade before stopping |
| `PeachTests/Core/Audio/SineWaveNotePlayerTests.swift` | Add test for click-free stop behavior |

### Files NOT to Modify

- `NotePlayer.swift` — protocol signature unchanged
- `TrainingSession.swift` — already calls `notePlayer.stop()` correctly
- `TrainingScreen.swift` — already triggers stop on disappear
- `MockNotePlayer.swift` — mock behavior doesn't need fade simulation

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit test:** Verify `stop()` sets mixer volume to 0 before stopping player node (or verify fade buffer is scheduled)
- **Regression:** Full test suite must pass — existing `SineWaveNotePlayerTests` and `TrainingSessionLifecycleTests` must be unaffected
- **Manual verification:** Play a note, navigate away mid-playback, confirm no click/pop

### Project Structure Notes

- Fix is entirely within `Peach/Core/Audio/` — aligned with existing structure
- No new files needed
- No new dependencies
