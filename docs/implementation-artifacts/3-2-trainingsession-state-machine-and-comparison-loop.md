# Story 3.2: TrainingSession State Machine and Comparison Loop

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **musician using Peach**,
I want to hear two notes in sequence and answer whether the second was higher or lower,
So that I can train my pitch discrimination through rapid comparisons.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a TrainingSession (@Observable), **When** it is initialized, **Then** it coordinates NotePlayer, TrainingDataStore, and a comparison source (using random comparisons at 100 cents as a temporary placeholder until Epic 4) **And** it progresses through states: idle → playingNote1 → playingNote2 → awaitingAnswer → showingFeedback → loop

2. **Given** the Training Screen is displayed, **When** training starts, **Then** the first comparison begins immediately — no countdown, no transition animation **And** the first note plays, followed by the second note

3. **Given** the user answers a comparison, **When** the answer is recorded, **Then** the result is written to TrainingDataStore **And** the next comparison begins immediately with no perceptible delay

4. **Given** the TrainingSession, **When** a service error occurs (audio failure, data write failure), **Then** the TrainingSession handles it gracefully — the user never sees an error screen **And** audio failure stops training silently **And** data write failure logs internally but training continues

5. **Given** the TrainingSession, **When** unit tests are run, **Then** all state transitions are verified using mock protocol implementations

## Dev Notes

### 🎯 CRITICAL CONTEXT: The Core Product Experience

**This is the heart of Peach.** Everything built before this story (data persistence, audio engine, navigation shell) exists to support what happens in this story: **the comparison loop**. This is where "training, not testing" becomes real.

**What makes this story critical:**
- **First time all systems integrate**: TrainingSession is the orchestrator that brings together NotePlayer (Story 2.1), TrainingDataStore (Story 1.2), and the Training Screen (Story 3.1 placeholder)
- **State machine complexity**: The training loop is a carefully choreographed state machine with precise timing requirements. Wrong transitions = broken training experience
- **User experience hinge**: If the loop feels slow, clunky, or confusing, the entire product fails its core promise. The round-trip between comparisons must be instantaneous
- **Error boundary**: TrainingSession must handle all service failures gracefully. The user should never see an error during training
- **Foundation for Epic 4**: The adaptive algorithm (Epic 4) will plug into TrainingSession's comparison generation. The architecture here determines how easy that integration will be

### Story Context

**Epic Context:** Epic 3 "Train Your Ear - The Comparison Loop" — the core product experience. Story 3.1 created the navigation shell. Story 3.2 (this story) implements the actual training logic. Stories 3.3 and 3.4 will add UI feedback and lifecycle handling.

**Why This Story Matters:**
- **FR2-FR3**: Users hear two notes and answer higher/lower — the fundamental interaction
- **FR8**: System disables answer controls during first note, enables during second — prevents premature answers
- **NFR2**: Next comparison begins immediately — no perceptible delay. This is the "zero-delay looping" pattern from the UX spec
- **Architecture validation**: First real test of the protocol-based service architecture. TrainingSession depends on NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore through protocols, enabling full test isolation

**User Impact:**
- Without TrainingSession: no training loop, app is non-functional
- With slow loop: users get frustrated, lose focus, stop using the app
- With broken state machine: notes play at wrong times, buttons enabled incorrectly, confusing experience
- With visible errors: users lose trust, app feels unstable

**Cross-Story Dependencies:**
- **Story 1.2 (done)**: Provides TrainingDataStore protocol and ComparisonRecord model
- **Story 2.1 (done)**: Provides NotePlayer protocol and SineWaveNotePlayer implementation
- **Story 3.1 (done)**: Provides Training Screen placeholder and navigation structure
- **Story 3.3 (next)**: Will add Feedback Indicator visual and haptic feedback — TrainingSession needs showingFeedback state for this
- **Story 3.4 (future)**: Will add app lifecycle handling — TrainingSession needs stop() method
- **Epic 4 (future)**: Will replace random placeholder with adaptive algorithm — TrainingSession's comparison generation is a clear extension point

### Technical Stack — Exact Versions & Frameworks

Continuing from Stories 1.1-3.1:
- **Xcode:** 26.2
- **Swift:** 6.0
- **iOS Deployment Target:** iOS 26
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI with @Observable pattern (not ObservableObject)
- **State Management:** @Observable macro (Swift 6.0) for TrainingSession
- **Concurrency:** Swift Concurrency (async/await, Task) for audio coordination
- **Testing Framework:** Swift Testing (@Test, #expect())
- **Dependencies:** Zero third-party (SPM clean)

**New in This Story:**
- First use of @Observable for complex state machine
- First use of Swift Concurrency for coordinating audio playback timing
- First time integrating multiple protocol-based services in a single class
- First comprehensive error handling boundary implementation

### Architecture Compliance Requirements

**From Architecture Document [docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md]:**

**TrainingSession as Central Orchestrator (Architecture lines 143-156):**

TrainingSession is the state machine coordinating the training loop. It owns the lifecycle of a comparison:
1. Ask strategy for next comparison (placeholder: random 100 cents)
2. Play note 1
3. Play note 2
4. Await answer
5. Record result
6. Show feedback
7. Repeat

States: `idle` → `playingNote1` → `playingNote2` → `awaitingAnswer` → `showingFeedback` → (loop)

**Service Layer Protocol Dependencies (Architecture lines 149-156):**

| Component | Responsibility | TrainingSession Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `NotePlayer` (protocol) | Plays a single note at a given frequency with envelope | TrainingSession calls playNote() for note1 and note2 |
| `TrainingDataStore` | Stores/retrieves comparison records | TrainingSession writes ComparisonRecord after each answer |
| `NextNoteStrategy` (protocol) | Returns next comparison | **Not in this story** — placeholder random generation until Epic 4 |
| `PerceptualProfile` | In-memory aggregate of user's ability | **Not in this story** — Epic 4 |

**Data Flow (Architecture lines 157-164):**

For Story 3.2 (simplified, no adaptive algorithm yet):
1. Training loop: TrainingSession generates random comparison (100 cents) → tells NotePlayer to play note 1, then note 2 → user answers → result written to TrainingDataStore
2. No profile update yet (Epic 4)

**Dependency Injection (Architecture lines 163-164):**
- NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore injected into TrainingSession via initializer
- SwiftUI environment passes TrainingSession to Training Screen
- Protocol-based design enables full mock testing

**Project Structure (Architecture lines 282-326):**
```
Peach/
├── Training/
│   ├── TrainingSession.swift     # CREATE IN THIS STORY
│   └── TrainingScreen.swift      # UPDATE FROM PLACEHOLDER
```

TrainingSession belongs in Training/ directory because it's part of the training feature. It's not in Core/ because it's feature-specific orchestration, not a reusable service.

**Error Handling (Architecture lines 249-260):**

**TrainingSession as error boundary:**
- TrainingSession catches all service errors and handles them gracefully
- The user never sees an error screen during training
- Audio failure → stop training silently (transition to idle, log error)
- Data write failure → log internally, continue training (one record lost is acceptable)
- The training loop is resilient — individual failures don't break the experience

**Typed error enums per service:**
- AudioError (defined in Story 2.1): `.engineStartFailed`, `.playbackFailed`, etc.
- DataStoreError (defined in Story 1.2): `.saveFailed`, `.fetchFailed`, etc.
- TrainingSession uses exhaustive catch patterns for each error type

**SwiftUI Patterns (Architecture lines 263-267):**
- Use `@Observable` (iOS 26) — NOT `ObservableObject` / `@Published`
- Views observe TrainingSession state changes
- Views are thin: Training Screen observes state, renders, sends actions (button taps)
- No business logic in views — all logic in TrainingSession

### UX Design Requirements

**From UX Design Specification [docs/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md]:**

**The Core Experience (UX lines 56-67):**

The comparison loop is the **defining experience** of Peach. The loop must feel **reflexive, not deliberative**. The user should be reacting to sounds, not thinking about an app. The ideal state is flow — a rhythmic back-and-forth between listening and tapping where the app disappears and only the sounds and responses remain.

**Critical Success Moment: First 10 Seconds (UX lines 88-91):**

The user taps Start Training and is immediately in a rhythm of listening and tapping. If this moment feels clunky, slow, or confusing, the app has lost. This is the moment where "training, not testing" must be felt, not explained.

**Experience Mechanics - The Comparison Loop (UX lines 316-361):**

**Step-by-step choreography:**

1. **Initiation:** User taps Start Training → Training Screen appears → first comparison begins immediately (no countdown)
2. **First Note:** System plays note1 → Higher/Lower buttons disabled (stock SwiftUI `.disabled()`)
3. **Second Note:** System plays note2 → buttons become enabled the moment second note begins → user can answer during or after note2
4. **Answer:** User taps Higher or Lower → both buttons disable immediately (prevent double-tap) → feedback phase begins instantly
5. **Feedback:** Feedback Indicator appears (Story 3.3) → persists ~300-500ms → clears
6. **Clear and Loop:** Comparison result written to data store → algorithm selects next → next first note begins → return to step 2

**Loop continues indefinitely until user navigates away.**

**Zero-Delay Looping Requirement (UX lines 64, 192, NFR2):**

The round-trip between comparisons must be **effectively instantaneous**. Every millisecond of dead time between comparisons is a design failure. The next comparison must begin the moment the previous one resolves.

**Timing Diagram (UX lines 396-402):**
```
[Note 1 ~~~] [Note 2 ~~~] [Answer] [Feedback ··] [Note 1 ~~~] [Note 2 ~~~] ...
 buttons off   buttons on   tap!     brief show    buttons off   buttons on
```

**Button State Management (UX lines 768-776):**
- Higher/Lower buttons disabled during note1 (prevents premature answers)
- Buttons enabled when note2 begins playing (user can answer immediately)
- Buttons disabled immediately on tap (prevents double-tap)
- This is the **only dynamic button state in the entire app**

**Training Screen Implementation (UX lines 638-657):**

| Component | Implementation | Story 3.2 Action |
|---|---|---|
| Higher/Lower buttons | `Button` with `.disabled()` state | Bind to TrainingSession.state |
| Settings button | `Button` with `Image(systemName: "gearshape")` | Keep from Story 3.1 placeholder |
| Profile button | `Button` with `Image(systemName: "chart.xyaxis.line")` | Keep from Story 3.1 placeholder |
| Feedback Indicator | SF Symbols thumbs up/down | **Story 3.3** — leave placeholder space |

**Sensory Hierarchy: Ears > Fingers > Eyes (UX lines 163-164, 909-927):**

Audio is primary (the training content), haptic is secondary (result feedback - Story 3.3), visual is tertiary (optional confirmation). The Training Screen must function as a purely audio experience where visuals are optional during active training.

### Architecture Deep Dive: TrainingSession State Machine

**State Enum Definition:**
```swift
enum TrainingState {
    case idle              // Training not started or stopped
    case playingNote1      // First note playing, buttons disabled
    case playingNote2      // Second note playing, buttons enabled
    case awaitingAnswer    // Both notes finished, buttons enabled, waiting for tap
    case showingFeedback   // Answer recorded, feedback showing (Story 3.3)
}
```

**State Transitions:**

```
idle
 ↓ startTraining()
playingNote1
 ↓ note1 completes
playingNote2
 ↓ note2 completes
awaitingAnswer
 ↓ handleAnswer(isHigher:)
showingFeedback
 ↓ feedback duration expires
playingNote1 (next comparison)
 ↓ ...continues loop
```

**Critical Implementation Details:**

1. **Immediate loop start**: `startTraining()` must transition directly to `playingNote1` and trigger note playback with no delay
2. **Button enable timing**: Transition to `playingNote2` must happen **the moment** the second note begins playing, not after it completes. This enables users to answer during the second note.
3. **Zero-delay continuation**: The transition from `showingFeedback` back to `playingNote1` (next comparison) must be immediate. Generate next comparison while feedback is showing, so it's ready instantly.
4. **Error resilience**: Any service error (audio or data) must transition to `idle` cleanly without exposing errors to the UI

**Comparison Value Type (Temporary Placeholder):**

Until Epic 4 implements the adaptive algorithm, TrainingSession generates random comparisons:

```swift
struct Comparison {
    let note1: Int        // MIDI note (e.g., 60 for middle C)
    let note2: Int        // Same MIDI note as note1 (for now)
    let centDifference: Double  // Always 100.0 for placeholder (1 semitone)
    let isSecondNoteHigher: Bool // Randomly true or false
}
```

**Placeholder generation logic:**
- Select random MIDI note between 48 (C3) and 72 (C5) for note1
- note2 = note1 (same MIDI note)
- centDifference = 100.0 (1 semitone, easily detectable for testing)
- isSecondNoteHigher = Bool.random()
- Convert MIDI + cent offset to frequency using formula from Story 2.2

**Why this placeholder works:**
- Simple, testable, no algorithm complexity
- Easily detectable interval (100 cents = 1 semitone)
- Epic 4 will replace random generation with AdaptiveNoteStrategy — same Comparison structure, just different generation logic

### Previous Story Intelligence

**Key Learnings from Story 3.1 (Start Screen and Navigation Shell):**

**1. Stock SwiftUI Patterns Work Perfectly:**
- Story 3.1 used zero custom components — all stock SwiftUI
- Navigation, buttons, layouts all standard
- Continue this pattern: TrainingSession state drives stock SwiftUI button `.disabled()` states

**2. @Observable Pattern Established:**
- iOS 26 uses `@Observable` macro, not `ObservableObject`
- TrainingSession must use `@Observable` for SwiftUI observation
- No `@Published` properties — `@Observable` tracks changes automatically

**3. Protocol-Based Architecture:**
- NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore are protocols with concrete implementations
- TrainingSession depends on protocols, not concrete types
- Enables full mock testing (create MockNotePlayer, MockTrainingDataStore for tests)

**4. Hub-and-Spoke Navigation:**
- Story 3.1 established NavigationDestination enum and hub-and-spoke pattern
- Training Screen already has Settings/Profile navigation buttons in placeholder
- Keep this structure — just replace placeholder content with functional training loop

**5. Zero Warnings Standard:**
- Every story maintains zero warnings build
- Continue this standard

**6. Code Review is Thorough:**
- Story 3.1 code review found: unused @State variables, architecture violations, deprecated API usage
- Expect review to check: state machine correctness, error handling completeness, timing precision
- Write comprehensive tests before review

**Files Modified in Story 3.1:**
- **Created:** StartScreen.swift, TrainingScreen.swift (placeholder), ProfileScreen.swift (placeholder), SettingsScreen.swift (placeholder), InfoScreen.swift, NavigationDestination.swift
- **Updated:** ContentView.swift (NavigationStack), Localizable.xcstrings (auto-generated)

**Files to Create/Modify in Story 3.2:**
- **CREATE:** Training/TrainingSession.swift (core state machine)
- **CREATE:** Training/Comparison.swift (value type for comparison data)
- **UPDATE:** Training/TrainingScreen.swift (replace placeholder with functional implementation)
- **CREATE:** PeachTests/Training/TrainingSessionTests.swift (comprehensive state machine tests)
- **UPDATE:** App/ContentView.swift or PeachApp.swift (inject TrainingSession into environment)

**Story 3.1 Patterns to Continue:**
- SF Symbols for icons (if adding any visual elements)
- `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)` for primary buttons (Higher/Lower are primary)
- SwiftUI environment for dependency injection
- `#Preview` macros for visual verification
- Comprehensive test coverage before marking complete

2. **Test coverage matters**: Story 3.1 had 12 tests for relatively simple navigation. Story 3.2's state machine will need comprehensive test coverage (expect 20+ tests)
3. **Review will check**:
   - State machine correctness (all transitions valid, no invalid states)
   - Error handling completeness (audio and data failures handled)
   - Mock usage in tests (not testing actual NotePlayer/TrainingDataStore)
   - Timing precision (zero-delay loop requirement)
   - SwiftUI integration (proper @Observable usage)

4. **Code review categories from Story 3.1**:
   - **Critical**: Architecture violations, fundamental design flaws
   - **High**: Incorrect patterns, deprecated APIs
   - **Medium**: Missing documentation, inconsistent naming
   - **Low**: Minor improvements, style issues

5. **Be proactive**: Address potential review issues during implementation:
   - No unused state properties
   - All state transitions explicitly tested
   - Error handling for every service call
   - Comprehensive documentation of state machine logic
   - Timing verified (zero-delay loop)

### What NOT To Do

- **Do NOT** implement adaptive algorithm (that's Epic 4) — use random 100-cent comparisons as placeholder
- **Do NOT** implement PerceptualProfile integration (Epic 4) — no profile updates in this story
- **Do NOT** implement Feedback Indicator visual/haptic (that's Story 3.3) — showingFeedback state exists but no UI yet
- **Do NOT** implement app lifecycle handling (that's Story 3.4) — just implement core loop, no backgrounding yet
- **Do NOT** implement Higher/Lower button visual feedback (Story 3.3) — just enable/disable states
- **Do NOT** use ObservableObject (deprecated pattern) — use @Observable macro
- **Do NOT** add loading states or progress indicators — training starts immediately
- **Do NOT** add session summaries or statistics — training is sessionless
- **Do NOT** expose errors to the UI — TrainingSession is error boundary
- **Do NOT** add configurable comparison settings yet (Epic 6) — hardcode placeholder values
- **Do NOT** implement profile visualization on Training Screen — that's Epic 5
- **Do NOT** add custom audio controls (volume, play/pause) — system volume only
- **Do NOT** use hardcoded delays between comparisons — timing must be dynamic based on audio completion
- **Do NOT** implement "stop training" button — navigation away is how training stops (Story 3.4)

### Performance Requirements (NFRs)

**From PRD [docs/planning-artifacts/prd.md]:**

**NFR2: Transition between comparisons** (line 64)
- Next comparison must begin immediately after the user answers
- **No perceptible loading or delay**
- **Target**: < 100ms round-trip from answer to next note1 playing
- **Implementation strategy**: Pre-generate next comparison during feedback phase, so it's ready instantly when feedback clears

**NFR1: Audio latency** (line 63)
- Time from triggering a note to audible output must be imperceptible (target < 10ms)
- **This is handled by SineWaveNotePlayer (Story 2.1)** — TrainingSession just needs to call playNote() without delays

**NFR10: Training data must survive app crashes** (line 72)
- **Handled by TrainingDataStore (Story 1.2)** — SwiftData provides atomic writes
- **TrainingSession responsibility**: Write ComparisonRecord immediately after answer, before transitioning to showingFeedback
- If crash occurs during feedback, the record is already persisted

**Performance Verification:**
- Use Instruments Time Profiler to measure comparison round-trip time
- Add timing logs: answer tap timestamp → next note1 playback start timestamp
- Target: consistently < 100ms on iPhone 17 Pro
- If slower: investigate data write performance, async coordination overhead

### FR Coverage Map for This Story

| FR | Description | Story 3.2 Action |
|---|---|---|
| FR2 | User can hear two sequential notes | TrainingSession plays note1 → note2 via NotePlayer |
| FR3 | User can answer higher or lower | TrainingSession.handleAnswer(isHigher:) records answer |
| FR8 | System disables controls during note1, enables during note2 | TrainingSession.state drives button .disabled() |
| FR27 | System stores every answered comparison | Write ComparisonRecord to TrainingDataStore after each answer |

**Partially Covered:**
- FR1 (start training with single tap) — Training Screen functional but immediate start is Story 3.4
- FR4-FR5 (visual/haptic feedback) — showingFeedback state exists but Story 3.3 implements UI

**Not Covered in This Story:**
- FR6-FR7 (stop training, interruption handling) — Story 3.4
- FR9-FR15 (adaptive algorithm) — Epic 4
- FR21-FR26 (profile visualization) — Epic 5
- FR30-FR36 (settings) — Epic 6

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Audio Coordination Timing (Architecture line 366):**

When NotePlayer plays a note, TrainingSession needs to know when it completes so it can transition to the next state. Two approaches:

1. **Callback-based**: NotePlayer calls a completion handler when note finishes
2. **Async-based**: NotePlayer's play method is async, returns when complete

**Recommended: Async-based** (cleaner with Swift Concurrency)

**NotePlayer protocol signature** (from Story 2.1):
```swift
protocol NotePlayer {
    func play(frequency: Double, duration: TimeInterval) async throws
    func stop()
}
```

**TrainingSession usage:**
```swift
func startComparison() async {
    state = .playingNote1
    try await notePlayer.play(frequency: note1Frequency, duration: noteDuration)

    state = .playingNote2  // ← Happens immediately when note1 completes
    try await notePlayer.play(frequency: note2Frequency, duration: noteDuration)

    state = .awaitingAnswer
}
```

**Error Handling Coordination:**

- TrainingSession wraps NotePlayer calls in do-catch
- On AudioError: log error, transition to idle, training stops silently
- On DataStoreError: log error, continue training (one record lost is acceptable)
- SwiftUI observes TrainingSession.state — idle state shows Training Screen without active loop

**Frequency Calculation (from Story 2.2):**

TrainingSession needs to convert MIDI note + cent offset → frequency:

**Formula:**
```swift
func frequency(midiNote: Int, centOffset: Double, referencePitch: Double = 440.0) -> Double {
    let a4MidiNote = 69
    let semitonesFromA4 = Double(midiNote - a4MidiNote) + (centOffset / 100.0)
    return referencePitch * pow(2.0, semitonesFromA4 / 12.0)
}
```

**For Story 3.2 placeholder:**
- Use default reference pitch 440Hz (settings are Epic 6)
- Use default note duration 1.0 second (settings are Epic 6)
- Generate random comparisons at 100 cents

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Automated with Mocks):**

Story 3.2 requires comprehensive state machine testing with mock dependencies.

**Mock Implementations Needed:**

```swift
class MockNotePlayer: NotePlayer {
    var playCallCount = 0
    var lastFrequency: Double?
    var lastDuration: TimeInterval?
    var shouldThrowError = false

    func play(frequency: Double, duration: TimeInterval) async throws {
        playCallCount += 1
        lastFrequency = frequency
        lastDuration = duration
        if shouldThrowError {
            throw AudioError.playbackFailed
        }
        // Simulate playback duration
        try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(10))
    }

    func stop() {
        // Mock implementation
    }
}

class MockTrainingDataStore: TrainingDataStore {
    var saveCallCount = 0
    var lastSavedRecord: ComparisonRecord?
    var shouldThrowError = false

    func save(_ record: ComparisonRecord) async throws {
        saveCallCount += 1
        lastSavedRecord = record
        if shouldThrowError {
            throw DataStoreError.saveFailed
        }
    }

    func fetchAll() async throws -> [ComparisonRecord] {
        return []
    }
}
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

1. **State Transitions (8-10 tests):**
   - Test: idle → playingNote1 on startTraining()
   - Test: playingNote1 → playingNote2 after note1 completes
   - Test: playingNote2 → awaitingAnswer after note2 completes
   - Test: awaitingAnswer → showingFeedback on handleAnswer()
   - Test: showingFeedback → playingNote1 (next comparison loop)
   - Test: any state → idle on stop() [Story 3.4 will add, but structure for it now]
   - Test: error during playingNote1 → idle
   - Test: error during playingNote2 → idle

2. **Comparison Generation (2-3 tests):**
   - Test: random comparison has note1 MIDI between 48-72
   - Test: centDifference is 100.0
   - Test: isSecondNoteHigher is random (test multiple generations)

3. **NotePlayer Integration (3-4 tests):**
   - Test: playNote called twice per comparison (note1, note2)
   - Test: correct frequency calculation from MIDI + cents
   - Test: audio error stops training (transitions to idle)
   - Test: playNote called with correct duration

4. **TrainingDataStore Integration (3-4 tests):**
   - Test: ComparisonRecord created on handleAnswer()
   - Test: record saved to data store after answer
   - Test: correct/wrong recorded accurately based on user answer
   - Test: data error logged but training continues

5. **Timing and Coordination (2-3 tests):**
   - Test: zero delay between comparisons (feedback → next note1 immediate)
   - Test: buttons disabled during note1
   - Test: buttons enabled during note2

**Total Test Count Target: 18-24 tests** (Story 3.1 had 12 tests for simple navigation; state machine is more complex)

**Manual Verification:**

- Run app, tap Start Training, verify two notes play in sequence
- Verify Higher/Lower buttons disabled during note1, enabled during note2
- Tap Higher or Lower, verify buttons disable immediately
- Verify next comparison starts immediately after feedback (Story 3.3 will add visible feedback)
- Verify audio sounds clean with no clicks or artifacts (NotePlayer test)
- Test error cases manually: disconnect audio device during training (should stop silently)

**Integration Test (Story 3.3):**

When Story 3.3 adds Feedback Indicator, test complete loop:
- Start training → two notes play → answer → feedback shows → next comparison → repeat 10 times
- Verify continuous flow with no pauses

### Implementation Sequence for This Story

**Order of Implementation:**

1. **Create Comparison Value Type**
   - Create Training/Comparison.swift
   - Define Comparison struct (note1, note2, centDifference, isSecondNoteHigher)
   - Add frequency calculation helper (MIDI + cents → Hz)
   - Add random placeholder generation static method
   - Write tests for frequency calculation accuracy
   - Build and verify compiles

2. **Create TrainingSession State Machine Skeleton**
   - Create Training/TrainingSession.swift
   - Mark as @Observable
   - Define TrainingState enum (idle, playingNote1, playingNote2, awaitingAnswer, showingFeedback)
   - Add @Published state property (or let @Observable track it)
   - Add protocol dependencies (NotePlayer, TrainingDataStore) via initializer
   - Add startTraining(), handleAnswer(isHigher:), stop() method signatures (empty implementations)
   - Build and verify compiles

3. **Implement State Machine Logic**
   - Implement startTraining(): idle → playingNote1, call NotePlayer.play() for note1
   - Add async note1 completion → transition to playingNote2, call NotePlayer.play() for note2
   - Add async note2 completion → transition to awaitingAnswer
   - Implement handleAnswer(isHigher:): create ComparisonRecord, save to TrainingDataStore, transition to showingFeedback
   - Add feedback duration Task.sleep(), then transition back to playingNote1 (next comparison loop)
   - Wrap all NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore calls in do-catch with error handling
   - Build and verify compiles (will fail at runtime without real dependencies, but syntax should be clean)

4. **Write Mock Implementations**
   - Create PeachTests/Training/MockNotePlayer.swift
   - Create PeachTests/Training/MockTrainingDataStore.swift
   - Implement mock methods with counters, last values, error flags
   - These mocks will be used in all TrainingSession tests

5. **Write Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - Create PeachTests/Training/TrainingSessionTests.swift
   - Test state transitions (8-10 tests)
   - Test comparison generation (2-3 tests)
   - Test NotePlayer integration (3-4 tests)
   - Test TrainingDataStore integration (3-4 tests)
   - Test timing and coordination (2-3 tests)
   - Run tests, debug failures, iterate until all pass (18-24 tests passing)

6. **Update Training Screen**
   - Replace placeholder Training/TrainingScreen.swift
   - Inject TrainingSession via SwiftUI environment
   - Observe TrainingSession.state to drive button .disabled() states:
     - Disabled when state is playingNote1 or showingFeedback
     - Enabled when state is playingNote2 or awaitingAnswer
   - Wire Higher button tap → TrainingSession.handleAnswer(isHigher: false)
   - Wire Lower button tap → TrainingSession.handleAnswer(isHigher: true)
   - Add onAppear { trainingSession.startTraining() } to start immediately
   - Keep Settings/Profile navigation buttons from Story 3.1
   - Add #Preview with mock TrainingSession for visual verification
   - Build and run

7. **Integrate TrainingSession into App**
   - Update App/PeachApp.swift or App/ContentView.swift
   - Create TrainingSession instance with real NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore
   - Pass TrainingSession via SwiftUI environment
   - Verify dependency injection works
   - Run app, test training loop end-to-end

8. **Manual Verification**
   - Run app, tap Start Training
   - Verify two notes play in sequence (should be easily detectable 1-semitone difference)
   - Verify buttons disable/enable correctly
   - Verify next comparison starts immediately
   - Test 10+ comparisons in a row — verify continuous flow
   - Test navigation away during training (Settings/Profile) — verify training stops (graceful failure for now, Story 3.4 will handle properly)

9. **Performance Profiling**
   - Use Instruments Time Profiler
   - Measure comparison round-trip time (answer → next note1)
   - Target: < 100ms consistently
   - If slower: investigate data write, async coordination
   - Add timing logs if needed for debugging

10. **Documentation**
    - Update this story file with completion notes
    - Document any deviations from spec
    - Note Story 3.3 integration points (Feedback Indicator)
    - Note Story 3.4 integration points (lifecycle handling)
    - Note Epic 4 integration points (adaptive algorithm)
