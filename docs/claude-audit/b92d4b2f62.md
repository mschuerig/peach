<command-name>/bmad-bmm-create-story</command-name>
<command-args>7-3</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:07)

I'll start by loading the workflow system files.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:11)

Now let me load the config source and the workflow components.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:24)

Good. All workflow components loaded. Let me resolve variables and execute **Step 1: Determine target story**.

The user provided `7-3`, so: `epic_num = 7`, `story_num = 3`. I need to find the story title and key. Let me load the sprint status and epics file.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:34)

**Step 1 complete.** Story identified:
- **Story ID:** 7.3
- **Story Key:** `7-3-iphone-ipad-portrait-and-landscape-support`
- **Epic 7** is already `in-progress` — no update needed.

Now proceeding to **Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts.** Let me run the discover_inputs protocol and load all source documents.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:44)

Good. I have the epics content with Story 7.3 details. Now let me load all remaining artifacts in parallel for exhaustive analysis.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:08:55)

Now let me analyze the current screen implementations to understand existing layout patterns for the device/orientation story.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:10:14)

Excellent. I now have a thorough understanding of all artifacts. Let me summarize the **discover_inputs** results:

- ✓ Loaded **{epics_content}** from `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md` — Story 7.3 acceptance criteria extracted
- ✓ Loaded **{architecture_content}** from `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` — layout/device constraints
- ✓ Loaded **{ux_content}** from `docs/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md` — responsive design, orientation patterns
- ✓ Loaded **{previous_story_7-2}** and **{previous_story_7-1}** — learnings from both prior stories
- ✓ **Git intelligence** — 15 recent commits analyzed, 246 tests pass
- ✓ **Codebase analysis** — all 10+ screen/component files analyzed for layout patterns
- ○ No project-context.md found

Now proceeding to **Step 5: Create comprehensive story file**. Writing the template and generating all sections.

---

**Story Header & Requirements (template-output: story_header + story_requirements)**

### 🤖 Assistant (08:14:24)

Story file written. Here's the generated content for the first section:

**Story 7.3: iPhone, iPad, Portrait, and Landscape Support**
- User story: musician wants the app to work on iPhone/iPad in any orientation
- 5 acceptance criteria covering iPhone portrait/landscape, iPad, windowed mode, and iPhone 17 Pro testing
- 7 tasks covering TrainingScreen layout adaptation, StartScreen spacing, ProfileScreen heights, verification of Settings/Info/ContentView, iPad testing, layout tests, and regression testing

Key dev notes highlight:
- Only **TrainingScreen** needs explicit layout changes (VStack → HStack in landscape)
- **StartScreen** needs compact spacing adjustments
- **ProfileScreen** needs reduced heights in compact mode
- Settings, Info, ContentView need **no changes** (stock SwiftUI handles it)
- Use `@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass)` — the SwiftUI-native approach
- **No iPad-specific layouts, no split views, no sidebars** per architecture

**[a]** Advanced Elicitation, **[c]** Continue, **[p]** Party-Mode, **[y]** YOLO the rest of this document only.

What would you like to do?

### 🧑 Human (08:19:58)

### 🤖 Assistant (08:20:01)

Now proceeding to **Step 6: Update sprint status and finalize**.

First, let me run the validation checklist, then update the sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:20:06)

Story file verified. Now updating the sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:20:13)

Sprint status updated. Now let me commit this story creation.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:20:19)

I see `Peach/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` was already modified before this session (pre-existing change from git status at conversation start). I'll only commit the story-related files.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:20:30)

**ULTIMATE BMad Method STORY CONTEXT CREATED, Michael!**

**Story Details:**
- **Story ID:** 7.3
- **Story Key:** `7-3-iphone-ipad-portrait-and-landscape-support`
- **File:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-3-iphone-ipad-portrait-and-landscape-support.md`
- **Status:** ready-for-dev
- **Commit:** `452e5af`

**Story Summary:**
- **3 screens need changes:** TrainingScreen (VStack→HStack in landscape), StartScreen (compact spacing), ProfileScreen (reduced heights)
- **2 screens need no changes:** SettingsScreen (stock Form), InfoScreen (stock sheet)
- **Core technique:** `@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass)` — the SwiftUI-native approach
- **7 tasks** covering layout adaptation, verification, testing, and regression

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the comprehensive story in the file
2. Run `dev-story` for optimized implementation
3. Run `code-review` when complete (auto-marks done)

## Session 2 (`cf582e17…`)

*2026-02-18 08:22:37 UTC → 2026-02-18 08:27:56 UTC*

### 🧑 Human (08:22:37)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>
<command-args>7-3</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (08:22:40)

I'll start by loading the workflow system files.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:22:45)

Now I need to load the config source and the instructions file.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:22:52)

Now executing **Step 1: Find next ready story and load it**. The argument is "7-3", so I need to find the story file for this. Let me load the sprint status and discover the story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:22:57)

Found story 7-3. Let me load the complete story file and the project context.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:23:13)

Before I start implementing, I need to check for uncommitted changes per CLAUDE.md instructions.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:23:18)

There's an uncommitted change to `Localizable.xcstrings`. Let me check what it is.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:23:27)

The `Localizable.xcstrings` change is just Xcode reordering JSON keys alphabetically (de before en) — no content changes. Per CLAUDE.md, we need a clean working directory before starting. Should I commit this cosmetic reorder to clear the working state before beginning story 7.3 implementation?

### 🤖 Assistant (08:27:14)

Good, clean working directory. Now let me proceed with the workflow.

---

**Step 2: Load project context** — No `project-context.md` found, but the story Dev Notes contain comprehensive context.

**Step 3: Detect review continuation** — No "Senior Developer Review (AI)" section exists in the story file.

🚀 **Starting Fresh Implementation**

- **Story:** 7-3-iphone-ipad-portrait-and-landscape-support
- **Story Status:** ready-for-dev
- **First incomplete task:** Task 1 — Add size-class-aware layout to TrainingScreen

---

**Step 4: Mark story in-progress**

### 🤖 Assistant (08:27:46)

🚀 Starting work on story 7-3-iphone-ipad-portrait-and-landscape-support
Status updated: ready-for-dev → in-progress

---

Now entering **Step 5: Implement tasks following red-green-refactor cycle**. Let me start with **Task 1: Add size-class-aware layout to TrainingScreen**. First, I need to read the current source files.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:27:50)

Now let me check existing test patterns and the other screens I'll need to modify.

### 🤖 Assistant (08:27:56)

Let me check the existing test patterns and the PianoKeyboardView height parameter.
