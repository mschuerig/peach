## Commit message

Mark 4 resolved items in future-work.md

Audio clicks, reset-all-data difficulty, feedback icon flicker,
and Kazez coefficient divergence are all resolved — update their
entries to match the existing RESOLVED format.

Hi Michael! Quinn here, your QA Engineer. You've got a specific task for me — let me dig into the future-work items and cross-reference them against the current codebase to see what's already been addressed.

Let me investigate the unresolved items systematically.

### 🤖 Assistant (23:03:10)

Got it, Michael — you already know about those three fixes. What you're really asking is: **which of the still-open items can we knock out now?**

Here are the quick wins I see — items that are straightforward code changes, not design/research/feature work:

**Trivial (can fix in minutes):**

| # | Item | Effort |
|---|------|--------|
| O1 | Dead code `previousScenePhase` in `ContentView.swift` | Delete 2 lines |
| D4 | `hasTrainingData` duplicated across views | Add `hasData` computed property to `PerceptualProfile`, use it in both views |
| D3 | Kazez coefficient difference undocumented | Add a cross-reference comment explaining the intentional 0.05 vs 0.08 divergence |

**Small (under an hour):**

| # | Item | Effort |
|---|------|--------|
| Extract Environment Keys | Move `PerceptualProfileKey` to `PerceptualProfile.swift` | Straightforward move, follows existing `TrendAnalyzerKey` pattern |
| S3 | `ComparisonRecordStoring` protocol incomplete | Add `delete`/`deleteAll` to the protocol |
| D1 | `makeTrainingSession()` duplicated across 6+ test files | Extract shared factory to `TrainingTestHelpers.swift` |

**Not resolvable right now** (require design decisions, research, or significant architecture work):
- Seamless playback investigation, rolling window, convergence persistence, onboarding, profile graph redesign, progress over time, session boundaries, swappable sounds, iPad haptics — all feature/design work
- U3/U4/U5, S1, S2 — need architectural decisions or careful concurrency refactoring
- O2 — `KazezNoteStrategy` range issue is a latent bug but touching it risks side effects

Want me to tackle the trivial and small items? I can start with the three trivial ones.

### 🧑 Human (23:07:36)

I don't want you to do any work on the actual code! I think we forgot to mark some issues as resolved.

Also, regarding D3: The difference in the coefficient is intentional, because the algorithm behaves differently, when there is only one difficulty tracked (the original algorithm) vs when difficulty is tracked across a range (as in our algorithm).

### 🤖 Assistant (23:07:49)

Understood! Let me mark the resolved items in the document. That's three code fixes plus D3 with your explanation.

### 🤖 Assistant (23:09:10)

Now D3 — marking it resolved with your explanation about the coefficient difference.

### 🤖 Assistant (23:09:24)

Done. I've marked four items as resolved in `future-work.md`:

1. **Audio Clicks When Navigating Away** — fade-out before stop
2. **Reset All Data Should Also Reset Difficulty** — `resetTrainingData()` clears convergence chain
3. **Feedback Icon Flicker** — animation driven by `showFeedback` only
4. **D3: Kazez Coefficients Differ** — intentional: single-difficulty (0.05) vs range-tracked (0.08) algorithms

### 🧑 Human (23:11:08)
