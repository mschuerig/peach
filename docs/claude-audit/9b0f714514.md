*2026-02-13 13:10:40 UTC → 2026-02-13 13:22:35 UTC*

### 🧑 Human (13:10:40)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>

### 🤖 Assistant (13:10:45)

I'll help you execute the dev-story workflow. Let me start by loading the core workflow system.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:10:55)

Perfect! I've loaded the workflow engine and the dev-story workflow configuration. Now I'll execute the workflow according to the workflow.xml rules.

## Step 1: Load and Initialize Workflow

### Step 1a: Loading Configuration and Resolving Variables

### 🤖 Assistant (13:11:10)

Perfect! I've loaded all the configuration and instructions. Variables resolved:

**Configuration:**
- Project: peach
- User: Michael (intermediate skill level)
- Language: English
- Story Directory: `/Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/implementation-artifacts`
- Sprint Status: `/Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

Now executing the workflow...

## Step 1: Find Next Ready Story

Let me check the sprint status to find the next story ready for development.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:11:16)

Perfect! I found the next story ready for development:

**Story:** `3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell`
**Status:** ready-for-dev

Let me load this story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:11:25)

Perfect! Story loaded successfully.

**Story:** 3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell
**Current Status:** ready-for-dev
**First Incomplete Task:** Task 1: Create Start Screen UI

---

## Step 2: Load Project Context

Let me load the project context to understand coding standards and patterns.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:11:33)

✅ **Context Loaded**

Story and project context available for implementation. The story file contains comprehensive Dev Notes with:
- Architecture patterns (hub-and-spoke navigation)
- Technical stack (iOS 26, SwiftUI, NavigationStack)
- UX requirements (stock SwiftUI only, SF Symbols)
- Previous story learnings

---

## Step 3: Detect Review Continuation

Checking if this is a fresh start or continuation after code review...

🚀 **Starting Fresh Implementation**

**Story:** 3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell
**Story Status:** ready-for-dev
**First incomplete task:** Task 1: Create Start Screen UI

No previous review section found - this is a fresh implementation.

---

## Step 4: Mark Story In-Progress

Let me update the sprint status to mark this story as in-progress.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:11:58)

🚀 **Starting work on story 3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell**

Status updated: ready-for-dev → in-progress

---

## Step 5: Implement Tasks Following Red-Green-Refactor

Let me start by exploring the current project structure to understand what exists.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:12:12)

Perfect! All required directories exist. Now let me start implementation following the sequence outlined in the Dev Notes.

### Task 1: Create Start Screen UI

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Update ContentView.swift with NavigationStack
2. Create StartScreen.swift with all required components
3. Create placeholder screens
4. Write navigation tests

Let me start:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:12:17)

Now let me create the Start Screen:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:12:29)

Good! Now let me create the placeholder screens:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:12:45)

Let me build the project to see if it compiles:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:13:57)

Let me build with an available simulator:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:14:08)

Perfect! **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - all screens are created and the app compiles successfully.

Now let me check the existing test structure and write navigation tests:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:14:26)

Now I'll create comprehensive navigation tests following the project's Swift Testing pattern:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:14:46)

Now let me run the tests to verify everything works:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:14:56)

I need to fix the tests - `is some View` syntax is not allowed in runtime checks. Let me rewrite the tests to be more appropriate:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:15:28)

Now let me run the tests again:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:17:30)

Perfect! **TEST SUCCEEDED** - All tests pass including the new navigation tests!

Now let me update the story file to mark tasks as complete:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:18:14)

Now let me update the sprint status to mark the story for review:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:18:21)

Perfect! Now let me commit the changes:

### 🤖 Assistant (13:22:21)

Excellent! All changes committed successfully.

## Step 9-10: Story Completion

✅ **Story Implementation Complete and Ready for Review**

**Story:** 3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell
**Status:** review (ready for code review)

### Key Accomplishments

**Created 5 New Screens:**
1. **StartScreen.swift** - Main hub with Start Training button, navigation buttons, and profile placeholder
2. **TrainingScreen.swift** - Placeholder for Epic 3 Story 2
3. **SettingsScreen.swift** - Placeholder for Epic 6
4. **ProfileScreen.swift** - Placeholder for Epic 5
5. **InfoScreen.swift** - Complete implementation with app info and version

**Navigation Architecture:**
- Established hub-and-spoke navigation pattern using NavigationStack
- All secondary screens return to Start Screen
- Type-safe navigation with NavigationDestination enum
- Info Screen uses `.sheet()` modal presentation

**Testing:**
- Created StartScreenTests.swift with 12 comprehensive tests
- All 75 tests in test suite pass
- Navigation, view instantiation, and hub-and-spoke pattern verified

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Zero warnings
- ✅ All tests pass

### Files Modified
- **Created:** StartScreen.swift, TrainingScreen.swift, SettingsScreen.swift, ProfileScreen.swift, InfoScreen.swift, StartScreenTests.swift
- **Modified:** ContentView.swift, story file, sprint-status.yaml

### Next Steps

**Recommended actions:**
1. **Review the implemented story** - Verify acceptance criteria and test the app
2. **Run code review workflow** - Use `/bmad-bmm-code-review` workflow (preferably with a different LLM for fresh perspective)
3. **Verify deployment readiness** if applicable

💡 **Tip:** For best results, run code review using a **different** LLM than Claude Sonnet 4.5 that implemented this story.

Michael, the Start Screen and navigation shell are now complete! The app has its first UI screens and navigation structure. Would you like me to explain:
- How the hub-and-spoke navigation pattern works?
- Why certain technical decisions were made?
- How to test or verify the changes?
- Anything else about the implementation?

### 🧑 Human (13:22:21)

</task-notification>
Read the output file to retrieve the result: /private/tmp/claude-502/-Users-michael-Projekte-peach/tasks/beb15dd.output

### 🤖 Assistant (13:22:35)

Perfect! The story implementation workflow is complete. 

## Summary

✅ **Story 3.1: Start Screen and Navigation Shell - COMPLETE**

**What was accomplished:**
- Created the first UI screens for the Peach app
- Established navigation architecture (hub-and-spoke pattern)
- Built foundation for all future screens in the app
- All acceptance criteria satisfied
- All tasks completed and tested
- Story marked for review in sprint status

**Technical highlights:**
- 5 new SwiftUI views created (Start, Training, Settings, Profile, Info)
- NavigationStack-based navigation with type-safe routing
- Stock SwiftUI components throughout (HIG-compliant)
- 12 new navigation tests added (all passing)
- Zero warnings, clean build

**Current status:**
- Story file: `docs/implementation-artifacts/3-1-start-screen-and-navigation-shell.md`
- Status: **review** (ready for code review)
- Sprint status updated
- All changes committed

**Next recommended steps:**
1. Test the app manually to verify the UI looks good
2. Run `/bmad-bmm-code-review` workflow for code review
3. After review passes, move on to Story 3.2 (TrainingSession implementation)

Would you like to proceed with code review, or would you like me to explain any part of the implementation first?
