### 🧑 Human (15:16:25)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:28)

I'll start by loading the workflow engine and the specific workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:32)

Now I'll load the config source and the instructions file.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:38)

Good, I've loaded all workflow components. Now executing **Step 1: Find next ready story and load it**.

Let me check the sprint status file.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:43)

I found the first `ready-for-dev` story: **1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure**. Let me load that story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:52)

Now let me check for the project context file (Step 2).

### 🤖 Assistant (15:16:59)

Good, no project-context.md exists. Now executing **Steps 2-3**:

**Step 2: Context Loaded** - Story and dev notes are fully parsed. No project-context.md file found (not required).

**Step 3: Fresh Implementation Detection** - No "Senior Developer Review (AI)" section found in the story file.

---

**Starting Fresh Implementation**

- **Story:** 1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure
- **Story Status:** ready-for-dev
- **First incomplete task:** Task 1: Create Xcode project (AC: #1, #2)

---

Now executing **Step 4: Mark story in-progress** in sprint-status.yaml.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:17:15)

Starting work on story **1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure**
Status updated: ready-for-dev → in-progress

---

Now executing **Step 5: Implement tasks following red-green-refactor cycle**.

This is an Xcode project setup story. Since this involves creating an Xcode project with specific structure, I need to understand the current state of the repo first.

### 🧑 Human (15:20:42)

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### 🧑 Human (15:20:58)

I've fixed xcodebuild. Try the last command again.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:24:59)

Xcode 26.2 is installed (the story mentions 26.3 but this is close enough - the project format and APIs are identical). Let me now implement the tasks.

**Starting Task 1: Create Xcode project**

First, I'll create all the directories and source files.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:25:04)

Now let me create all the source files in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:25:14)

Now let me create the .gitkeep files for empty folders and the Xcode project files.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:25:20)

Now let me create the Xcode project file (project.pbxproj) using the modern objectVersion 77 format with file system synchronized groups.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:26:11)

All files created. Now let me try to build the project to verify everything works (Task 5: Verify build and run).

### 🧑 Human (15:28:07)

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### 🧑 Human (15:30:46)

Before we proceed, change the reference iPhones to iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. Those are devices I actually have and can use for testing.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:31:11)

iPhone 17 Pro is available as a simulator. Note that iPhone 11 Pro isn't listed — it doesn't have a simulator for the iOS 26 SDK (which makes sense since the deployment target is iOS 26). I'll use **iPhone 17 Pro** as the primary build/test simulator.

A quick note: iPhone 11 Pro won't support iOS 26, so it can't be used for testing this app. Only the iPhone 17 Pro from your devices will work.

Let me now proceed with the build using iPhone 17 Pro.

### 🧑 Human (15:31:43)

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### 🧑 Human (15:32:12)

It's okay to run simulator tests only on iPhone 17 Pro. Change relevant documents accordingly.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:32:16)

Let me find any documents referencing iPhone models.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:32:25)

These references are about testing on different screen sizes for layout validation (Epic 7 - polish/ship). They're about screen size extremes, not about simulator targets for development. Since the user said to use iPhone 17 Pro only, let me update these references.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:32:41)

Updated both documents to reference iPhone 17 Pro. Now let me proceed with the build.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:34:35)

The build failed because the file system synchronized group picks up `.gitkeep` files as resources, and multiple files with the same name conflict. I need to exclude `.gitkeep` files from the build. Let me update the project file.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:34:40)

I need to add `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedBuildFileExceptionSet` entries to exclude `.gitkeep` files from both targets. Let me update the pbxproj.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:34:50)

Now let me try building again.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:35:02)

**BUILD SUCCEEDED!** Now let me run the tests to verify the test target works.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:36:19)

**TEST SUCCEEDED!** The placeholder test passes on iPhone 17 Pro simulator. All tasks are verified:

- Build succeeds
- App runs on simulator
- Test target works with Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `#expect()`)
- Placeholder test passes

Now let me update the story file with progress. Let me mark all completed tasks and update the Dev Agent Record.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:36:32)

Let me verify zero warnings with a clean build.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:36:46)

One benign system warning from `appintentsmetadataprocessor` (Xcode internals, not code-related). No Swift compiler warnings. This is acceptable.

Now let me update the story file - marking all tasks complete and updating the Dev Agent Record.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:37:20)

Now update the sprint status to "review".

### 🤖 Assistant (15:37:30)

Story status updated to "review" in sprint-status.yaml.

Now let me commit all changes per the CLAUDE.md policy.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:42:08)

**Story 1.1 implementation is complete and ready for review, Michael.**

Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Key Changes:**
- **Peach.xcodeproj** created with modern objectVersion 77 format (file system synchronized groups)
- **PeachApp.swift** — `@main` entry point with SwiftUI App protocol, SwiftData `ModelContainer` (empty schema for now)
- **ContentView.swift** — basic root view displaying "Peach"
- **Full folder structure** matching the architecture document: App/, Core/Audio/, Core/Algorithm/, Core/Data/, Core/Profile/, Training/, Profile/, Settings/, Start/, Info/, Resources/
- **PeachTests** target mirroring source structure with Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect()`)
- **Resources** — Assets.xcassets (AccentColor + AppIcon) and Localizable.xcstrings (English source, German in knownRegions)
- **iPhone 17 Pro** set as the reference test device in planning docs

**Verification:**
- Build succeeds on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
- Placeholder test passes using Swift Testing framework
- Zero code warnings, zero third-party dependencies

**Story file:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure.md` (status: review)

Would you like me to explain any technical decisions, or would you like to proceed with the next step (e.g., running `code-review`)?

> **Tip:** For best results, run `code-review` using a **different** LLM than the one that implemented this story.

### 🧑 Human (15:50:34)

I've opened the project in Xcode, which has created some more files. Commit them.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:50:43)

Those are `xcuserdata/` directories — these contain user-specific Xcode settings (window positions, breakpoints, scheme preferences). These should **not** be committed as they're personal to each developer and will cause conflicts.

I'd recommend adding them to `.gitignore` instead. Want me to create a `.gitignore` for the project?

### 🧑 Human (15:51:02)

Yes, add them to .gitignore.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:51:21)

Done. The `.gitignore` now excludes `xcuserdata/`, `build/`, `DerivedData/`, and `.DS_Store`.
