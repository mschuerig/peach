<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>
<command-args>7-4</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (10:02:06)

I'll start by loading the workflow system files.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:02:11)

Now I'll load the config source and instructions file.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:02:24)

Good, I have the workflow loaded and variables resolved. Now executing **Step 1**: Find the story file for argument "7-4".

Let me search for the story file and load the sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:02:27)

Found the story file. Let me load it along with the project context.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:02:39)

Story loaded and parsed. Now executing **Steps 2-3**: Loading context and checking for review continuation.

**Step 2:** No `project-context.md` found. Story Dev Notes loaded with comprehensive context.

**Step 3:** No "Senior Developer Review (AI)" section exists.

🚀 **Starting Fresh Implementation**

- Story: `7-4-info-screen`
- Story Status: `ready-for-dev`
- First incomplete task: Task 1 — Update InfoScreen.swift with new content

Now executing **Step 4**: Marking story in-progress in sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:03:04)

🚀 Starting work on story `7-4-info-screen`
Status updated: ready-for-dev → in-progress

Now let me also read the existing localization file and any existing tests for InfoScreen.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:03:14)

Let me find existing test files that might reference InfoScreen.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:04:33)

Now I have full context. Executing **Step 5** — implementing tasks following the red-green-refactor cycle.

---

### Task 1: Update InfoScreen.swift with new content

**RED PHASE:** Writing a failing test first for the testable logic — the `gitHubURL` static property.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:04:38)

Now let me confirm the test fails (since `gitHubURL` doesn't exist yet).

### 🤖 Assistant (10:04:52)

Test fails as expected — `Type 'InfoScreen' has no member 'gitHubURL'`. RED phase confirmed.

**GREEN PHASE:** Now implementing InfoScreen.swift with the new content.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:05:03)

Now let me run the tests to confirm they pass.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:06:10)

**TEST SUCCEEDED** — all tests pass, including the new `gitHubURL` test. GREEN phase complete.

Task 1 subtasks satisfied:
- [x] Developer email address added below developer name
- [x] GitHub project URL as a tappable `Link` component
- [x] License line showing "MIT License" (via `"License: MIT"` localized label pattern)
- [x] Copyright year displays as "© 2026"
- [x] Stock SwiftUI layout with clear section grouping (two VStack groups: developer info + project info)
- [x] Light/dark mode works (stock SwiftUI, no custom colors)

---

### Task 2: Update localization strings

Now I need to add localized strings for the new labels. The new strings to add are:
- `"License: %@"` → German: `"Lizenz: %@"`
- `"GitHub"` → German: `"GitHub"` (proper noun, stays same)

### 🤖 Assistant (10:06:22)

Now I'll add the new localization strings. I need to add `"GitHub"` and `"License: %@"` in alphabetical order.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:06:31)

Now let me run the full test suite to verify localization changes don't break anything.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:08:26)

All tests pass. Task 2 localization subtasks satisfied:
- [x] Added `"GitHub"` with German translation `"GitHub"` (proper noun)
- [x] Added `"License: %@"` with German translation `"Lizenz: %@"`
- [x] Existing Info screen strings remain correct (all unchanged)
- [x] App name, developer name, email, and URL are NOT localized (verbatim or interpolated values)

---

### Task 3: Update tests

The test for `gitHubURL` was already added in Task 1's RED phase. Let me verify all Task 3 subtasks:
- InfoScreen still presents as sheet from StartScreen — existing `infoScreenCanBeInstantiated` test covers this (spot-check)
- New unit test for `gitHubURL` — already added
- Need to run full test suite — already done, all pass
- Zero regressions — confirmed

All 3 tasks are complete. Let me now move to **Step 8** — validate and mark tasks complete, then update the story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:08:30)

Now I'll update the story file — marking all tasks complete, updating the Dev Agent Record, File List, Change Log, and Status.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:08:55)

Now update the sprint status to "review".

### 🤖 Assistant (10:09:00)

Now let me run the full test suite one final time to confirm everything is green before marking completion.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:09:59)

**TEST SUCCEEDED** — all tests pass, zero regressions.

---

**Step 10: Completion**

Michael, story 7.4 implementation is complete and ready for review.

### Summary

**Story:** 7.4 — Info Screen
**Status:** `review`

**What was implemented:**
- **InfoScreen.swift** — Added developer full name ("Michael Schürig"), email address, tappable GitHub `Link` component, "License: MIT" label, and reorganized layout into clear visual groups (app identity → developer info → project/legal info)
- **Localizable.xcstrings** — Added `"GitHub"` and `"License: %@"` → `"Lizenz: %@"` with German translations
- **StartScreenTests.swift** — Added `infoScreenHasCorrectGitHubURL()` test for the static URL property

**All 6 acceptance criteria satisfied:**
1. Info Screen presents as `.sheet()` from Start Screen (unchanged)
2. Shows app name, developer name+email, version, GitHub link, MIT license, copyright
3. Stock SwiftUI layout with clear visual hierarchy
4. Dismissible via swipe or Done button (unchanged)
5. Labels localized; proper nouns/identifiers remain as-is
6. GitHub link uses SwiftUI `Link` component (opens in system browser)

**Files modified:** `Peach/Info/InfoScreen.swift`, `Peach/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`, `PeachTests/Start/StartScreenTests.swift`, `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-4-info-screen.md`, `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

**Next steps:**
- Review the changes and test in Simulator (both light/dark mode, both languages)
- Run `code-review` workflow (recommended with a different LLM)
- Check `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` for overall project progress
