### 🤖 Assistant (08:59:44)

Now let me check what artifacts already exist to determine your progress.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:00:20)

Now I have a clear picture of your project. Here's your **BMAD Help** overview:

## Project Status: Peach

You're in **Phase 4 — Implementation** and have made excellent progress. Here's the current state:

### Completed
- **Epics 1–4, 7**: All done (Data Foundation, Audio Engine, Comparison Loop, Adaptive Algorithm, Polish & Ship)
- **Sprint 2026-02-22 hotfixes**: All done (signed mean, audio clicks, reset data, icon flicker)
- **Infrastructure**: SF2 build/download cache done
- **Epics 5, 6, 8, 9, 10**: All stories within are **done** — these epics could be marked as `done` in sprint-status.yaml
- **One backlog hotfix**: `hotfix-profile-band-segmentation` (confidence band draws across untrained gaps)

### What's Next

Since all planned stories are implemented, here are your recommended next steps:

---

**1. Sprint Status** (recommended first) — `/bmad-bmm-sprint-status`
- Agent: 🏃 Bob (Scrum Master)
- Update epic statuses to `done`, review backlog hotfix, and get a clean status picture

**2. Backlog Hotfix: Profile Band Segmentation**
- Still in `backlog` — use `/bmad-bmm-create-story` to prepare it, or `/bmad-bmm-quick-dev` if it's a small fix

**3. Code Review** — `/bmad-bmm-code-review`
- Agent: 💻 Amelia (Developer)
- Run a code review on recent work (Epic 10 stories) if not already done

**4. Retrospective** — `/bmad-bmm-retrospective`
- Agent: 🏃 Bob (Scrum Master)
- Optional but recommended — review completed epics, capture lessons learned

**5. Correct Course** — `/bmad-bmm-correct-course`
- Agent: 🏃 Bob (Scrum Master)
- If you want to plan new features or epics beyond the current roadmap

### Anytime Utilities

| Workflow | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Quick Dev | `/bmad-bmm-quick-dev` | Quick one-off tasks without full planning |
| Quick Spec | `/bmad-bmm-quick-spec` | Lightweight spec for small additions |
| Document Project | `/bmad-bmm-document-project` | Generate project docs |

Run each workflow in a **fresh context window**. For validation workflows, consider using a different high-quality LLM if available.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:02:22)

Now let me load the workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:03:19)

Good, I've loaded all workflow components. Let me execute the Sprint Status workflow.

**Step 0** — Mode: interactive (default). Proceeding to Step 1.

**Step 1** — Sprint status file found at `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`.

**Step 2** — Parsing sprint-status.yaml...

All statuses are valid. Here's the parsed data:

**Stories** (37 total):
| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| backlog | 1 |
| ready-for-dev | 0 |
| in-progress | 0 |
| review | 0 |
| done | 36 |

**Epics** (10 total):
| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| backlog | 0 |
| in-progress | 5 |
| done | 5 |

**Retrospectives** (7 total):
| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| optional | 7 |
| done | 0 |

**Risks detected:**
- **Stale epic statuses:** Epics 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are marked `in-progress` but **all their stories are `done`**. These should be updated to `done`.
- **One backlog item remains:** `hotfix-profile-band-segmentation` — "Confidence band draws across untrained gaps despite segment logic"

**Step 3** — Next action recommendation:

Since the only non-done story is `hotfix-profile-band-segmentation` (backlog), the recommendation is: **`/bmad-bmm-create-story`** to prepare this hotfix for development.

## Sprint Status

- **Project:** peach (NOKEY)
- **Tracking:** file-system
- **Status file:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

**Stories:** backlog 1, ready-for-dev 0, in-progress 0, review 0, done 36

**Epics:** backlog 0, in-progress 5, done 5

**Next Recommendation:** `/bmad-bmm-create-story` (hotfix-profile-band-segmentation)

**Risks:**
- Epics 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 should be marked `done` — all their stories are complete
- `hotfix-profile-band-segmentation` remains in backlog

---

Pick an option:
1. Run recommended workflow now (`/bmad-bmm-create-story` for hotfix-profile-band-segmentation)
2. Show all stories grouped by status
3. Show raw sprint-status.yaml
4. Exit

Choice:

### 🧑 Human (09:08:13)

Apart from hotfix-profile-band-segmentation you can mark all epics as done.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:08:38)

Done. Updated epics 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 from `in-progress` to `done`.

**Updated sprint status:**

- **Epics:** backlog 0, in-progress 0, done **10**
- **Stories:** backlog 1, done 36
- **Remaining:** `hotfix-profile-band-segmentation` (backlog)

**Next recommendation:** `/bmad-bmm-create-story` to prepare the hotfix-profile-band-segmentation for development.

Pick an option:
1. Run recommended workflow now (`/bmad-bmm-create-story` for hotfix-profile-band-segmentation)
2. Show all stories grouped by status
3. Show raw sprint-status.yaml
4. Exit

### 🧑 Human (09:09:18)

What is the usual way to mark an epic as done?

### 🤖 Assistant (09:09:27)

Per the convention documented right in `sprint-status.yaml`:

```
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
```

The `backlog → in-progress` transition happens automatically via the `create-story` workflow, but **`in-progress → done` is a manual update** — exactly what we just did. The sprint-status workflow surfaces the discrepancy (all stories done but epic still in-progress), and then you confirm the update.

So this was the usual way.

### 🧑 Human (09:10:18)

4

### 🤖 Assistant (09:10:23)

Sprint status workflow complete. 

**Summary:** All 10 epics are now `done`. One backlog item remains (`hotfix-profile-band-segmentation`). When you're ready to tackle it, run `/bmad-bmm-create-story` in a fresh context window.

### 🧑 Human (09:10:42)

commit

### 🤖 Assistant (09:10:49)

Straightforward change — marking 5 completed epics as `done` in sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:10:59)

Committed as `c5e6679`. Working tree is clean.
