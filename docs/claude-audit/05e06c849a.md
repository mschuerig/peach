### 🤖 Assistant (22:40:44)

I'll start by loading the workflow engine and configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:40:48)

Now let me load the config source and the workflow components.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:40:59)

Good. All variables resolved:
- **user_name**: Michael
- **communication_language**: English
- **planning_artifacts**: `/Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/planning-artifacts`
- **implementation_artifacts**: `/Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/implementation-artifacts`
- **story_dir**: `/Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/implementation-artifacts`
- **date**: 2026-02-17

**Step 1: Determine target story** - User provided `7-1`, so epic_num=7, story_num=1.

Let me load the sprint status and epics file to resolve the full story key and context.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:41:08)

Target story identified:
- **epic_num**: 7
- **story_num**: 1
- **story_key**: `7-1-english-and-german-localization`
- **story_id**: 7.1
- Current status: **backlog**

This is the first story in Epic 7, so epic-7 will be updated from "backlog" to "in-progress".

Now proceeding to **Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts**. Let me load all relevant files in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:41:19)

Now let me do deep artifact analysis. Loading architecture, UX design, and the previous story for context continuity.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:41:26)

Excellent. All artifacts loaded. Now I need to do deep codebase analysis to understand the current state of strings and localization. Let me research the codebase in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:42:32)

Let me check the existing Localizable.xcstrings file and do web research on String Catalog best practices.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:47:57)

Now let me examine the specific files with complex accessibility strings that may need code changes for proper localization.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:48:57)

All research complete. I now have everything needed for a comprehensive story. Let me create the story file.

**Discovery Summary:**
- 37 strings already auto-extracted into `Localizable.xcstrings`
- Only "Peach" has a German translation so far
- Several files need code changes: `String` return values in accessibility/formatting methods bypass localization
- Manual "cent"/"cents" pluralization needs to use String Catalog's pluralization support
- `statItem(label:value:)` passes strings through `String` variables → `Text(variable)` won't be localized

Let me write the story document now. Starting with the header and story section.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:50:52)

Story file created. Here's a summary of what was generated:

**Story 7.1: English and German Localization** — `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-1-english-and-german-localization.md`

**Key findings from analysis:**
- 37 string keys already auto-extracted into `Localizable.xcstrings` — SwiftUI's `Text("literal")` auto-extraction is working
- Only "Peach" has a German translation so far
- **4 files need code changes** where `String` return values bypass the localization system:
  - `SummaryStatisticsView.swift` — format methods and accessibility methods
  - `ProfileScreen.swift` — accessibility summary
  - `ProfilePreviewView.swift` — accessibility label
  - `InfoScreen.swift` — "Developer: Michael" needs format string
- Manual "cent"/"cents" pluralization needs to use String Catalog "Vary by Plural"
- Full German translation table provided for all ~45 strings

**6 tasks defined:**
1. Fix `SummaryStatisticsView` localization (labels + pluralization + accessibility)
2. Fix `ProfileScreen` accessibility string
3. Fix `ProfilePreviewView` accessibility string
4. Fix `InfoScreen` developer label
5. Add all German translations to `Localizable.xcstrings`
6. Write tests

What would you like to do? **[a]** Advanced Elicitation, **[c]** Continue, **[p]** Party-Mode, **[y]** YOLO the rest of this document only.

### 🧑 Human (22:52:05)

### 🤖 Assistant (22:52:11)

Now proceeding to **Step 6: Update sprint status and finalize**.

Let me first update the sprint status file, then commit.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:52:20)

Sprint status updated:
- `epic-7`: backlog → **in-progress**
- `7-1-english-and-german-localization`: backlog → **ready-for-dev**

Now let me run the validation checklist.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:52:33)

Story document saved and sprint status updated. Validation is optional per the story template — it can be run before `dev-story` if desired.

**Story 7.1: English and German Localization — COMPLETE, Michael!**

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: 7.1
- Story Key: `7-1-english-and-german-localization`
- File: `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-1-english-and-german-localization.md`
- Status: ready-for-dev

**Sprint Status Updates:**
- Epic 7: backlog → **in-progress**
- Story 7.1: backlog → **ready-for-dev**

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the comprehensive story in `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-1-english-and-german-localization.md`
2. Run `dev-story` for optimized implementation
3. Run `code-review` when complete (auto-marks done)

**The developer now has everything needed for flawless implementation!**

Shall I commit this?

### 🧑 Human (22:53:46)

Yes.

### 🤖 Assistant (22:53:59)

Committed as `05e06c8` — "Add story 7.1: English and German Localization". Working tree is clean.
