Mark epic 16 done and close epic 17 (fulfilled by story 16.3)

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:11)

I'll start by loading the workflow execution framework and the create-story workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:16)

Now let me load the config source and all workflow components in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:28)

Good, I've loaded the workflow engine and configuration. Let me resolve variables and execute **Step 1: Determine target story**.

The user provided **17.1**, so:
- `epic_num` = 17
- `story_num` = 1

Now let me load the sprint status and discover the story key, then load all artifacts in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:36)

I can see epic 16 is the latest in sprint status and all its stories are done. The user wants story 17.1, but there's no Epic 17 in the sprint status yet. Let me load the epics file and other core artifacts to find Epic 17.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:41)

The epics file is very large. Let me search for Epic 17 specifically.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:59:53)

Excellent! Found the story. Let me set the variables:
- **epic_num** = 17
- **story_num** = 1
- **story_key** = `17-1-pitch-matching-button-and-navigation-routing`
- **story_title** = "Pitch Matching Button and Navigation Routing"
- **story_id** = 17.1

Epic 17 doesn't exist in sprint status yet, so I'll need to add it. Since story_num = 1, this is the first story in the epic — the epic needs to be created as "in-progress".

Now executing **Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts**. Let me launch parallel research agents to thoroughly analyze all artifacts.

### 🤖 Assistant (16:02:19)

All four research agents have completed their analysis. I have a **critical finding** to report before proceeding with story creation.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Story 17.1 is already fully implemented.**

All acceptance criteria from Epic 17, Story 1 ("Pitch Matching Button and Navigation Routing") were completed as part of **Story 16.3 (Pitch Matching Screen Assembly)**:

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Implemented In |
|---|---|---|
| "Pitch Matching" button below "Start Training" | Done | `StartScreen.swift` (16.3) |
| `.bordered` style (secondary prominence) | Done | `StartScreen.swift` (16.3) |
| `NavigationDestination.pitchMatching` case | Done | `NavigationDestination.swift` (16.3) |
| Navigation resolves to `PitchMatchingScreen` | Done | `StartScreen.swift` (16.3) |
| `PeachApp.swift` wires `PitchMatchingSession` | Done | `PeachApp.swift` (16.3) |
| `@Environment` injection via `@Entry` | Done | `PitchMatchingScreen.swift` (16.3) |
| Pitch matching begins automatically on tap | Done | `PitchMatchingScreen.onAppear` (16.3) |
| English + German localization | Done | `Localizable.xcstrings` (16.3) |
| All existing tests pass | Done | 537 tests passing |

Story 16.3 bundled the screen assembly together with the Start Screen integration, navigation routing, and `PeachApp.swift` wiring — which is exactly the scope of Story 17.1.

### 🤖 Assistant (16:04:02)

I'll add Epic 17 and Story 17.1 to the sprint status as done, and mark the epic as done since it only has one story.

### 🤖 Assistant (16:04:14)

Done. Sprint status updated:

- **Epic 16** → `done` (all 3 stories complete, was still `in-progress`)
- **Epic 17** → `done` (added with note: all ACs fulfilled by story 16.3)
- **Story 17-1** → `done` (added with note: implemented as part of 16-3)

**Next steps:** The next unfinished work in the epics is **Story 18.1: Display Pitch Matching Statistics on Profile Screen**. Would you like me to create that story?
