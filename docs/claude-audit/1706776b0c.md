Let me check if there's an existing session document for today.

No existing session found. Let me initialize a fresh one.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:48:33)

Welcome Michael! I'm excited to facilitate your brainstorming session. I'll guide you through proven creativity techniques to generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions.

**Let's set up your session for maximum creativity and productivity:**

**Session Discovery Questions:**

1. **What are we brainstorming about?** (The central topic or challenge)
2. **What specific outcomes are you hoping for?** (Types of ideas, solutions, or insights)

### 🧑 Human (13:50:14)

I want to find and document the core requirements for an iOS app for musicians that helps with hearing minute pitch differences.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:50:20)

Great topic, Michael! Let me make sure I've captured this clearly.

**Session Analysis:**

Based on your response, I understand we're focusing on **defining the core requirements for an iOS app that helps musicians train their ability to hear and distinguish minute pitch differences** — essentially fine-grained ear training beyond standard semitone recognition.

**Session Parameters:**

- **Topic Focus:** Core requirements discovery for a pitch discrimination training app for iOS musicians
- **Primary Goals:** Document a clear set of core requirements — the essential features, interactions, and design considerations that make this app effective and distinct

**Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve?**

### 🧑 Human (13:54:17)

The app is not targetted at people making music on iOS, but obviously to musicians who own an iPhone or iPad. For a lot of musicians, such as singers, string, woodwind and brass players, intonation is a challenge. This challenge starts with precisely hearing and distinguishing pitches. The app is intended to help with training this ability.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:54:23)

Thank you for the clarification, that's an important distinction!

**Session Analysis (Revised):**

We're focusing on **core requirements for an iOS app that trains musicians' ability to precisely hear and distinguish pitches**. The target audience is instrumentalists and vocalists — singers, string players, woodwind and brass players — for whom intonation is a constant practical challenge. The app addresses the foundational skill underneath good intonation: the ear itself. It's a training tool for pitch discrimination, not a performance or production tool.

**Session Parameters:**

- **Topic Focus:** Core requirements for an iOS pitch discrimination ear training app
- **Primary Goals:** Discover and document the essential requirements — what the app must do, who it serves, and what makes it effective for training fine pitch perception
- **Target Users:** Musicians (singers, string, woodwind, brass) who struggle with or want to sharpen intonation skills

**Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve?**

### 🧑 Human (13:54:53)

yes

### 🤖 Assistant (13:54:56)

Excellent! Session setup is locked in. Let me save this and get you set up for the next phase.

### 🤖 Assistant (13:56:08)
