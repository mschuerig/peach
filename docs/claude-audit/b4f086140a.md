### 🤖 Assistant (18:31:51)

I'll start by loading the core workflow engine and the specific workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:31:56)

Now let me load the config source and workflow components.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:32:09)

**Step 1: Determine Target Story**

User provided `11.1` - parsing as **Epic 11, Story 1**.

Setting variables:
- `epic_num` = 11
- `story_num` = 1

Now I need to load the sprint status and epics files to get the full story key and details. Let me proceed to Step 2.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:32:14)

I notice the sprint status file doesn't have Epic 11 entries yet. Let me load the epics file to find the Epic 11 story details.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:32:19)

Let me find Epic 11 specifically in the epics file.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:32:32)

I have the story details. Let me set the variables:

- **epic_num** = 11
- **story_num** = 1
- **story_key** = `11-1-rename-training-types-and-files-to-comparison`
- **story_title** = "Rename Training Types and Files to Comparison"
- **story_id** = 11.1

The sprint status doesn't yet have Epic 11 entries. I'll add them at the end.

Now proceeding to **Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts**. Let me do exhaustive analysis in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:34:54)

All three analysis agents have completed. I now have comprehensive intelligence. Let me now proceed to **Step 5: Create the comprehensive story file**.

I'll write the story header with the template first.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:34:59)

Let me verify a couple of critical details before writing the story.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:35:38)

Now let me check the test file counts for completeness.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:35:45)

Good. Now I have everything needed. Let me create the comprehensive story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:37:12)

Story file written. Let me now present the completed sections for your review.

**Story 11.1: Rename Training Types and Files to Comparison** has been written to `docs/implementation-artifacts/11-1-rename-training-types-and-files-to-comparison.md`

**What's covered:**

- **Story & ACs** -- Full user story with 9 acceptance criteria directly from the epics file
- **Tasks/Subtasks** -- 8 task groups with specific `git mv` commands and execution order
- **Rename Map** -- Clear table of all 6 renames plus directory changes
- **Anti-patterns** -- Warning about partial string replacement destroying `TrainingDataStore`/`TrainingSettings`
- **Complete file inventory** -- 12 source files, 18 test files, 4 additional test files outside the Training/ dir, plus docs and pbxproj
- **Environment key rename** -- `@Entry var trainingSession` -> `@Entry var comparisonSession`
- **Xcode project** -- Only line 45 in `.pbxproj` needs updating (automatic file discovery handles the rest)
- **Previous story intelligence** -- Patterns from 10.5 (factory helper rename, logger categories)
- **Method note** -- `nextComparison()` already has the correct name, no method rename needed

**[a]** Advanced Elicitation, **[c]** Continue, **[p]** Party-Mode, **[y]** YOLO the rest of this document only.

### 🧑 Human (18:39:14)

### 🤖 Assistant (18:39:30)

Proceeding to **Step 6: Update sprint status and finalize**.

First, let me update the sprint status file to add Epic 11 and mark the story as ready-for-dev.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:39:42)

Sprint status updated. Now let me report completion.

**ULTIMATE BMad Method STORY CONTEXT CREATED, Michael!**

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: 11.1
- Story Key: `11-1-rename-training-types-and-files-to-comparison`
- File: `docs/implementation-artifacts/11-1-rename-training-types-and-files-to-comparison.md`
- Status: ready-for-dev

**Sprint Status Updated:**
- Epic 11 set to `in-progress` (first story in epic)
- Story 11-1 set to `ready-for-dev`

**What the story contains:**
- 9 acceptance criteria with explicit rename map
- 8 task groups with exact `git mv` commands
- Complete file inventory: 12 source files, 18+ test files, pbxproj, docs
- Anti-pattern warning for partial string replacement (`TrainingDataStore`/`TrainingSettings` must NOT change)
- Environment key rename details (`@Entry var trainingSession` -> `comparisonSession`)
- Method confirmation: `nextComparison()` already has the correct name
- Previous story intelligence from 10.5 (factory helpers, logger categories)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the comprehensive story in the file
2. Run `dev-story` for optimized implementation
3. Run `code-review` when complete (auto-marks done)

### 🧑 Human (18:41:26)

### 🤖 Assistant (18:41:33)
