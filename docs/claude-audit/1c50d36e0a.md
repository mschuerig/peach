### 🧑 Human (14:20:53)

Commands are in the form `/command [args]`

### 🧑 Human (14:21:31)

<command-message>bmad-tea-testarch-test-review</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-tea-testarch-test-review</command-name>
<command-args>Read docs/test-artifacts/test-review.md and fix the P0 issues (fatalError replacements, defer cleanup, placeholder deletion, @MainActor addition).</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (14:21:33)

I'll start by loading the workflow system and configuration files.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:21:38)

Now I'll load the config source, instructions, template, and validation checklist.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:21:47)

Now let me load the first step file and the existing test review report.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:21:59)

I've loaded the test review. Now I need to read the actual test files to fix the P0 issues. The user's arguments specify four fix categories:

1. **fatalError replacements** → `Issue.record()` and `try #require()`
2. **defer cleanup** → UserDefaults tests
3. **placeholder deletion** → PeachTests.swift
4. **@MainActor addition** → StartScreenTests.swift

Let me create tasks and read all the affected files.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:22:16)

Now let me read all the affected test files in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:22:31)

I've read all affected files. Let me now execute the fixes systematically.

---

## Task 1: Replace `fatalError()` with `Issue.record()` in test helpers

### 🤖 Assistant (14:23:17)

Now the same for `TrainingSessionFeedbackTests.swift`:

### 🤖 Assistant (14:23:27)

## Task 2: Replace `guard/fatalError` with `try #require()` in test bodies

### 🤖 Assistant (14:23:30)

There are 6 `guard/fatalError` patterns in `TrainingSessionFeedbackTests.swift`. Let me replace each one.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:24:05)

## Task 3: Add `defer` cleanup for UserDefaults tests

### 🤖 Assistant (14:24:10)

There are 5 UserDefaults test methods. Each starts with `cleanUpSettingsDefaults()` and ends with `session.stop()` + `cleanUpSettingsDefaults()`. I need to add `defer { cleanUpSettingsDefaults() }` right after the first cleanup call, and remove the trailing `cleanUpSettingsDefaults()`.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:24:46)

Now remove the trailing `cleanUpSettingsDefaults()` from the last test:

### 🤖 Assistant (14:24:53)

## Task 4: Delete placeholder test

### 🤖 Assistant (14:25:08)

File deleted successfully.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:25:11)

## Task 5: Add `@MainActor` to StartScreenTests

### 🤖 Assistant (14:25:21)

Now let me build and run tests to verify everything compiles and passes.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:05)

The build succeeded (no compilation errors for our changes). The runtime crash is a destination issue (Mac "Designed for iPad" can't bootstrap the test process). Let me verify the build compiles clean:

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:23)

**TEST BUILD SUCCEEDED** -- all changes compile cleanly with zero errors.

Let me do a final verification of all the changes by spot-checking the modified files.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:27)

Zero `fatalError` calls remaining in tests.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:32)

4 `fatalError` → `Issue.record()` replacements in the helper functions (lines 49, 63, 56, 70). The other `Issue.record()` calls are pre-existing.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:36)

All 6 `guard/fatalError` patterns replaced with `try #require()`.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:40)

All 5 UserDefaults tests have `defer` cleanup.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:29:50)

`@MainActor` added to `StartScreenTests` struct.

## Summary of All Changes

All 5 P0 fix tasks completed. **TEST BUILD SUCCEEDED** with zero compilation errors.

| # | Fix | Files Changed | Details |
|---|-----|---------------|---------|
| 1 | `fatalError()` → `Issue.record()` in helpers | `TrainingSessionTests.swift`, `TrainingSessionFeedbackTests.swift` | 4 replacements in `waitForState`, `waitForPlayCallCount`, `waitForFeedbackToClear` |
| 2 | `guard/fatalError` → `try #require()` in test bodies | `TrainingSessionFeedbackTests.swift` | 6 replacements across feedback and haptic tests |
| 3 | `defer { cleanUpSettingsDefaults() }` added | `TrainingSessionTests.swift` | 5 tests in `TrainingSessionUserDefaultsTests`; removed redundant trailing cleanup calls |
| 4 | Deleted placeholder test | `PeachTests.swift` | File removed entirely |
| 5 | Added `@MainActor` | `StartScreenTests.swift` | Annotation added to struct |

**Result**: Zero `fatalError` calls remain in the test target. All test helpers now fail gracefully via `Issue.record()`, all precondition guards use `try #require()`, UserDefaults cleanup is failure-safe, and all test suites have proper `@MainActor` isolation.

### 🧑 Human (14:35:06)

Great. Please commit these changes. We're going to look after the remaining issues in another session.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:35:23)

Committed as `0bf633b`. The `docs/test-artifacts/` directory (containing the test review report) remains untracked for you to commit separately if desired.

### 🧑 Human (14:37:09)

Revise the test-review.md document to indicate which issues have been fixed. Or is there a better way for documenting this?

### 🤖 Assistant (14:37:15)

Good question. Updating the review document in-place risks muddying the audit trail -- the original review becomes hard to distinguish from the post-fix state. A better approach:

1. **Keep the original review as-is** (it's the historical record of what was found)
2. **Add a "Fix Log" section at the top** that documents what was addressed and when

This way anyone reading the review can see both the original findings and current status at a glance. The alternative -- a separate "remediation" document -- adds file sprawl for little benefit at this project's scale.

Let me add the fix log.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:37:33)

Done. The review now has a **Fix Log** table at the top (right after the header) with:

- A row per fix session recording date, commit hash, and what was addressed
- A **Remaining Open Issues** checklist so the next session can pick up where we left off

The original findings below remain untouched as the historical audit record.

### 🧑 Human (14:41:31)

Please commit the document.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:41:42)

Committed as `d9143dd`. Working tree is clean.
