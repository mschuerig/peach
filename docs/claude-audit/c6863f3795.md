🎉 **PARTY MODE ACTIVATED!** 🎉

Welcome Michael! All BMAD agents are here and ready for a dynamic group discussion. I've brought together our complete team of experts, each bringing their unique perspectives and capabilities.

**Here are a few of our collaborating agents today:**

- 📚 **Paige** - Technical Documentation Specialist who transforms complex concepts into accessible, structured documentation
- 📋 **John** - Product Manager veteran who cuts through fluff to what actually matters
- 🏗️ **Winston** - System Architect who balances 'what could be' with 'what should be'

Your topic — README and licensing for Peach — is a great one. Let me bring in the right voices.

---

📚 **Paige**: Oh, I love this conversation! A README is the front door to your project — it's the first thing anyone sees, and it sets the tone for everything. Before we dive into structure, though, the license choice actually *informs* the README, so let's get that settled first. I'll defer to the licensing expertise here, but I'm already thinking about what sections we'll need.

📋 **John**: Alright, let's cut to the chase. You said CC or open source — those are actually quite different beasts, and the choice depends on *what Peach is* and *who it's for*. Here's the key question: **Is Peach primarily code, or is it a mix of code and creative content (like documentation, assets, designs)?**

Because here's the thing:
- **Creative Commons licenses** (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, etc.) are designed for *creative works* — text, art, media. They're **not recommended for software** by Creative Commons themselves.
- **Open source licenses** (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, BSD, MPL) are designed for *code* and are recognized by the OSI.

If Peach is a Swift/iOS app (which it looks like from the codebase), you almost certainly want a proper open source license for the code.

🏗️ **Winston**: John's right, and I'll add the architectural perspective. Looking at this codebase — it's a SwiftUI iOS app with tests, localization strings, and assets. Pragmatically, here are the main contenders and their trade-offs:

| License | Permissions | Conditions | Good For |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| **MIT** | Very permissive — do almost anything | Just keep the copyright notice | Maximum adoption, simplicity |
| **Apache 2.0** | Permissive + patent grant | Copyright notice + state changes | Protection against patent trolls |
| **GPL v3** | Copyleft — derivatives must also be GPL | Source must be shared | Ensuring all derivatives stay open |
| **MPL 2.0** | File-level copyleft | Modified files must stay open, but can mix with proprietary | Balanced middle ground |

My honest recommendation? For a personal/portfolio iOS app you want people to learn from and potentially contribute to: **MIT** is the boring-technology choice — and I mean that as the highest compliment. It's simple, universally understood, and creates zero friction.

If you want some copyleft protection (ensuring improvements come back to the community), **MPL 2.0** is a nice middle ground that doesn't scare off contributors the way GPL can.

📋 **John** asks: **What's your goal with open-sourcing Peach, Michael? Is it mainly for portfolio visibility, community contributions, educational use, or something else? That'll help us narrow this down fast.**

### 🧑 Human (09:14:06)

Licensing may get more complicated when I later introduce 3rd party code or assets. In particular, I'd like to use existing instrument samples for a future NotePlayer implementation. These samples are likely going to be CC-licensed.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:14:34)

🏗️ **Winston**: Ah, now *this* is the kind of real-world complexity I like to plan for early. You're describing a **multi-license project** — and that's perfectly normal and manageable, but it does need a clear structure from the start. Here's the architectural view:

Your project will have two distinct categories of intellectual property:

1. **Source code** (Swift, configs, project files) → needs a software license
2. **Assets** (instrument samples, possibly images, sounds) → will carry their own licenses (likely CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, or CC-BY-NC depending on the source)

The key constraint is **license compatibility**. If your instrument samples are, say, CC-BY-NC (NonCommercial), that restricts what people can do with the *combined work* even if your code is MIT. You need to be aware of this but it doesn't *prevent* you from using MIT for your code — it just means the assets and code travel under separate terms.

The standard pattern is:

```
/LICENSE          ← your code license (e.g., MIT)
/NOTICE           ← attribution notices for all third-party works
/Assets/Samples/LICENSE   ← specific license for samples
```

This is how major projects like Android, Blender, and many game engines handle it. Code and assets are separately licensed, clearly documented.

📋 **John**: Winston's nailing the architecture. But let me flag the *strategic* implication you should decide now: **Do you want Peach to be usable commercially by others, or not?**

Here's why it matters:
- If you pick **MIT** for code + your samples end up being **CC-BY-NC** → anyone can use your *code* commercially, but they can't ship the *samples* commercially. They'd need to substitute their own samples. That's actually a clean separation.
- If you pick **GPL** for code + **CC-BY-NC** samples → now *both* code and assets have restrictions, which may discourage adoption.
- If you find **CC-BY or CC-BY-SA** samples (no NC restriction) → everything stays freely usable, no friction.

So the sample licenses you find later will constrain the *assets*, but they don't need to dictate your *code* license choice today.

📚 **Paige**: And this is exactly why we document it clearly from day one! I've seen too many projects where mixed licensing becomes a nightmare because nobody wrote it down early. Here's what I'd recommend for the README and project structure:

- A **top-level LICENSE** file for the code
- A **NOTICE** or **THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES** file that will grow as you add dependencies and assets
- A clear section in the README like: *"Source code is licensed under [X]. Audio samples and other media assets may be covered by separate licenses — see [link] for details."*

That way, when you add those instrument samples six months from now, the scaffolding is already there. You just drop in the attribution details.

🏗️ **Winston**: One more practical note — when you're shopping for instrument samples, prioritize **CC-BY** or **CC-BY-SA** over **CC-BY-NC** if you have the choice. NC creates a grey area that makes contributors nervous. CC-BY-SA (ShareAlike) is copyleft-flavored but compatible with most open source workflows. And public domain / CC0 samples are the simplest of all — no attribution needed, no restrictions.

📋 **John** asks: **Given all this, are you leaning toward MIT for the code? And do you have a sense yet of which sample libraries you might use — or is that still exploratory? Knowing the likely CC variant would help us lock down the full picture.**

### 🧑 Human (09:19:31)

When I asked Claude for sample libraries, it came up with

* Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra
* University of Iowa Musical Instrument Samples
* Versilian Community Sample Library
* London Philharmonic Orchestra Samples
* SoundFont collections (e.g., GeneralUser GS, Fluid R3)

I haven't investigated any further.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:19:35)

Good list — let me check the actual licensing on these before the team weighs in.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:23:51)

Excellent research find. Let the team break this down.

---

📋 **John**: Alright, now we're talking with *real data*. Let me cut through this fast. Here's the landscape:

| Library | License | Commercial OK? | Attribution? | Key Watch-Out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VCSL** | **CC0 (Public Domain)** | Yes | No | None — cleanest option |
| **FluidR3** | **MIT** | Yes | Yes (copyright notice) | Essentially no friction |
| **Philharmonia Orchestra** | **CC-BY-SA 3.0** | Yes | Yes | **ShareAlike** — derivatives must use same license |
| **U of Iowa MIS** | Custom ("no restrictions") | Yes | Not stated | **No formal license document** — legal grey area |
| **Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra** | CC Sampling Plus 1.0 | Derivatives only | Yes | **Retired license** since 2011 |
| **GeneralUser GS** | Custom v2.0 | Yes | Requested | **Sample provenance uncertain** — author admits it |

Also heads up — "London Philharmonic Orchestra Samples" is actually the **Philharmonia Orchestra**, a different ensemble. Common mix-up.

🏗️ **Winston**: Let me tier these by architectural risk for your project:

**Tier 1 — No friction, use freely:**
- **VCSL (CC0)** — Public domain. Zero obligations. This is the dream scenario.
- **FluidR3 (MIT)** — Just include the copyright notice. Done.

**Tier 2 — Usable, but read the fine print:**
- **Philharmonia Orchestra (CC-BY-SA 3.0)** — The ShareAlike clause means if you distribute modified versions of *the samples themselves*, those modifications must also be CC-BY-SA. For an app that *plays* the samples, you're fine — your Swift code stays under whatever license you choose. But this is the kind of thing that makes lawyers twitch, so document it clearly.

**Tier 3 — I'd avoid unless necessary:**
- **U of Iowa** — "No restrictions" on a website isn't a license. No formal legal document means no legal certainty.
- **Sonatina** — A *retired* CC license is a red flag. It works, but signals the ecosystem has moved on.
- **GeneralUser GS** — The author *himself* says he can't guarantee sample provenance. That's a "thanks but no thanks" for any project that cares about clean IP.

My recommendation: **Start with VCSL and/or FluidR3.** They give you the cleanest legal foundation. If you need orchestral depth beyond what those offer, the Philharmonia samples are a solid Tier 2 addition — just document the CC-BY-SA attribution properly.

📚 **Paige**: And from a documentation perspective, this actually *simplifies* the license story for Peach considerably. If you go with VCSL + FluidR3 as your primary sample sources:

- **Code:** MIT license (simple, one file)
- **Samples:** CC0 + MIT (basically: also simple)
- **NOTICE file:** just the FluidR3 copyright notice and Philharmonia attribution if you add those later

That's a very clean, very explainable README section. No scary legal walls of text. No "consult a lawyer" vibes. 

📋 **John** asks: **So — are you comfortable going with MIT for the code? And does the VCSL + FluidR3 combo sound like a good starting point for samples, with Philharmonia as a possible future addition?**

### 🧑 Human (09:25:12)

Please document these findings for the future, so that we don't have to do the work again.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:26:08)

📚 **Paige**: Done! I've saved the complete findings to `docs/planning-artifacts/sample-library-licensing-research.md`. It's got the full comparison table, tiered recommendations, per-library details with links, and the implications for Peach's licensing structure. Next time this comes up, everything's right there.

📋 **John**: Good. No re-research needed. Now — shall we circle back to the original question and lock down the code license and README?

_[Awaiting your response...]_

`[E] Exit Party Mode - End the collaborative session`

### 🧑 Human (09:28:52)

Great. It looks like MIT is the appropriate license for this project. I do not intend to make it into a commercial project. Can you write a README and LICENSE and NOTICE (if needed) for this? Or would you prefer a story specifically for this? BTW, I think "version 1.0" is a bit presumptuous. For now, let's go with version 0.1. There are existing files that need to be adapted.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:30:35)

📋 **John**: This is a clear, bounded task — three files plus a version bump. No story needed. Let's just ship it.

📚 **Paige**: Agreed. I've got everything I need from the codebase exploration. The "existing files that need to be adapted" — that's the `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` in the Xcode project, four occurrences. Let me draft everything up.

🏗️ **Winston**: One note on the version change — the pbxproj has four `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` entries (Debug/Release for both the app and test targets). All four should go to `0.1`.

---

Let me create all the files and make the version update.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:30:55)

Now the version bump — changing all four `MARKETING_VERSION` entries from `1.0` to `0.1`:

### 🤖 Assistant (09:31:02)

Now let me run the tests to make sure nothing is broken.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:32:02)

All tests pass. Here's the summary of everything that was created and changed:

---

📚 **Paige**: All done! Here's what we shipped:

**New files:**
- **`LICENSE`** — MIT License, copyright 2026 Michael Schürig
- **`README.md`** — Project overview, philosophy, features, build instructions, tech stack, and license section noting that future assets may have separate licenses
- **`NOTICE`** — Third-party notices scaffold, currently empty but ready for when instrument samples are added, with a pointer to the licensing research

**Modified files:**
- **`Peach.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — `MARKETING_VERSION` changed from `1.0` to `0.1` (all four build configurations)

📋 **John**: Clean separation. Code is MIT, the NOTICE file is ready to grow, and when you add those VCSL or FluidR3 samples down the road, you just drop in the attribution. No structural changes needed.

🏗️ **Winston**: And all tests still pass. The version bump flows through to the InfoScreen automatically since it reads from the bundle's `CFBundleShortVersionString`.

Please review the files and let me know if you'd like any changes. Want me to commit these?

### 🧑 Human (09:38:58)

I think we can remove talk about the future from NOTICE; only add it, when it becomes relevant. README.md needs a reference to the GitHub page for the app -- https://github.com/mschuerig/peach -- and a reference to the author. Do you agree?

### 🤖 Assistant (09:39:04)

📚 **Paige**: Absolutely. A NOTICE file that documents what *is*, not what *might be* — that's cleaner. And yes, a README without a link to its own repo and its author is missing the basics. Let me fix both.

📋 **John**: Agreed. Ship what's real now.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:39:15)

Done. NOTICE is trimmed to just the essentials, and README now has the repo link and author up top. Anything else to adjust, or shall I commit?

### 🤖 Assistant (09:42:27)

What a great session, Michael! We covered a lot of ground together. Let me have the team say goodbye...

📋 **John**: Sharp session. We came in with a vague "CC or open source?" and walked out with MIT for the code, a tiered sample library evaluation, and all the scaffolding in place. That's how you make decisions — data first, ship fast. See you next time.

📚 **Paige**: README, LICENSE, NOTICE — all clean, all honest about what's there *now* rather than what might be someday. That's good documentation practice. It was a pleasure, Michael!

🏗️ **Winston**: The multi-license architecture is set up properly from day one. When those instrument samples arrive, the structure will be waiting. Boring foundations, exciting possibilities. Until next time.

**Session Highlights:** We explored open-source licensing strategy for a mixed code-and-assets project, researched six candidate sample libraries with concrete license details, established MIT as the code license, created the project's public-facing files, and bumped the version to 0.1.

---

Party mode complete! You're back to normal operations. Would you like me to commit these changes?

### 🧑 Human (09:42:59)

Ok. Wrap it up. Add everything to git.

### 🤖 Assistant (09:43:13)

Committed. Five files — `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README.md`, `docs/planning-artifacts/sample-library-licensing-research.md`, and the version bump in `project.pbxproj`. Working tree is clean. Not pushed (you're 5 commits ahead of origin).
