<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>
<command-args>7-5</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (10:46:42)

I'll start by loading the workflow system. Let me read the required files.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:46:47)

Now let me load the config source and instructions.

<command-name>/bmad-bmm-dev-story</command-name>
<command-args>7-5</command-args>

### 🤖 Assistant (10:38:46)

I'll start by loading the workflow XML and the specific workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:38:50)

Now I'll load the config source and the instructions file.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:39:03)

Good, all workflow components are loaded. Now let me execute **Step 1** — find the story file. The argument `7-5` indicates a story identifier. Let me load the sprint status and find the story file.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:39:09)

The story `7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation` has status **backlog** in sprint-status.yaml. This means no story file has been created yet — the story only exists in the epic file.

Let me verify there's no story file and check the epic for details.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:39:32)

## Step 1: Find Story and Load It

The story `7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation` has status **backlog** in sprint-status.yaml, and no story file exists in the implementation artifacts directory.

Per the sprint status definitions:
- **backlog** = "Story only exists in epic file"
- **ready-for-dev** = "Story file created in stories folder"

The story details exist in the epics file (Epic 7, Story 7.5: App Icon Design and Implementation), but no implementation story file has been created with tasks, subtasks, dev notes, or the dev agent record structure needed for development.

---

📋 **Story 7-5 is not yet ready for development**

**Current Status:** `backlog` (story file not yet created)

**What would you like to do?**
1. Run `create-story` to create the story file for 7-5 from the epic with comprehensive context
2. Run `validate-create-story` to improve existing stories before development
3. Specify a particular story file to develop (provide full path)
4. Check sprint-status.yaml to see current sprint status

💡 **Tip:** You'll need to run `create-story` first to generate the story file with tasks/subtasks, dev notes, and acceptance criteria before the dev-story workflow can execute.

### 🧑 Human (10:40:55)

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:00)

HALT — Switching to the `create-story` workflow to generate the story file for 7-5.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:05)

The `create-story` skill can't be invoked directly from within this workflow. Let me execute it manually by loading and following the create-story workflow.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:19)

Good. I have all the create-story workflow components. Let me execute it now.

**Step 1: Determine target story**
- User provided `7-5` → `epic_num=7`, `story_num=5`
- `story_key = 7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation`
- `story_id = 7.5`
- Epic 7 is already `in-progress` — no change needed.

**Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts**

Let me load all relevant context in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:28)

Now let me load the previous story file, architecture, and UX docs in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:34)

Now let me examine the current project structure, particularly the Assets.xcassets area where the icon will go.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:41:57)

Excellent. I now have comprehensive context from all artifacts. Let me now create the story file.

**Step 5: Create comprehensive story file**

### 🤖 Assistant (10:43:05)

Story file created. Now **Step 6: Update sprint status and finalize**.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:43:17)

**🎯 Story 7.5 Created Successfully, Michael!**

**Story Details:**
- **Story ID:** 7.5
- **Story Key:** 7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation
- **File:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation.md`
- **Status:** ready-for-dev

**Key points about this story:**

This is an **asset-only story** — it requires creating a 1024x1024px PNG icon image and placing it in the Xcode asset catalog. There are no Swift code changes.

**Important note:** Task 1 (designing and creating the icon artwork) **cannot be done by an AI coding agent** — it requires a design tool (Figma, Sketch, etc.) or an AI image generation tool. The coding tasks (Task 2: updating Contents.json, Task 3: verification) are trivial once the artwork exists.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the story file at `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-5-app-icon-design-and-implementation.md`
2. Create the icon artwork before running `dev-story` (since the dev agent can't generate images)
3. Run `dev-story` for the Xcode integration and verification tasks
4. Run `code-review` when complete

Would you like to proceed with anything else, or would you like to discuss the icon design concept directions before creating the artwork?

### 🧑 Human (10:45:30)

ok

### 🤖 Assistant (10:45:48)

Let me commit the story creation.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:45:55)

There's an unrelated change to `Localizable.xcstrings` that was already present. I'll commit only the story-related files.

### 🤖 Assistant (10:46:00)

Committed. Story 7.5 is now `ready-for-dev` and waiting for icon artwork before the dev agent can integrate it.

### 🧑 Human (10:46:21)
