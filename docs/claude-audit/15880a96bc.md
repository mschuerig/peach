## Commit message

Refactor observer pattern: Remove redundant parameters and complete HapticFeedback integration

Architectural Improvements (Story 4.1 code review fixes):
- Created CompletedComparison struct bundling comparison + user answer + result
- Updated ComparisonObserver protocol to use CompletedComparison (eliminates redundant isCorrect parameter)
- Removed hapticManager dependency from TrainingSession (now just another observer)
- HapticFeedbackManager now conforms to ComparisonObserver

Benefits:
- Cleaner API: single parameter instead of two (comparison + isCorrect)
- Better separation of concerns: TrainingSession doesn't know about haptics
- Consistent observer pattern: all observers receive same CompletedComparison
- Timestamp included in CompletedComparison for accurate record-keeping

Changes:
- Comparison.swift: Added CompletedComparison struct with computed isCorrect property
- ComparisonObserver.swift: Updated protocol signature
- HapticFeedbackManager.swift: Added ComparisonObserver conformance
- TrainingSession.swift: Removed hapticManager dependency, uses observers only
- TrainingDataStore.swift, PerceptualProfile.swift: Updated to use CompletedComparison
- PeachApp.swift: Added hapticManager to observers array
- All test files: Updated to match new API
- 4-1-implement-perceptualprofile.md: Updated change log

Build verified: All changes compile successfully

## Session `d12c1755…`

*2026-02-14 17:26:43 UTC → 2026-02-14 17:52:16 UTC*

### 🧑 Human (17:26:43)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-create-story</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-create-story</command-name>

### 🤖 Assistant (17:26:47)

I'll help you create a new story by following the workflow system. Let me start by loading the core workflow instructions.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:26:55)

Perfect! I've loaded the workflow system. Now I'll execute the create-story workflow following the exact steps defined in workflow.xml.

## Step 1: Load and Initialize Workflow

### Substep 1a: Load Configuration and Resolve Variables

### 🤖 Assistant (17:27:09)

Excellent! I've loaded all required components. Now I'll execute the workflow steps.

### Substep 1b: Loading Required Components

Configuration resolved:
- Project: peach
- User: Michael  
- Planning artifacts: /Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/planning-artifacts
- Implementation artifacts: /Users/michael/Projekte/peach/docs/implementation-artifacts
- Date: 2026-02-14

Now proceeding to **Step 1: Determine target story**

### 🤖 Assistant (17:27:21)

Perfect! I found the sprint status. The first story with status "backlog" is:

**Story: 4-2-implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy**

Extracted details:
- epic_num: 4
- story_num: 2  
- story_title: implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy
- story_id: 4.2
- story_key: 4-2-implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy

This is NOT the first story in Epic 4 (4-1 is already done), so Epic 4 is already "in-progress" - no status update needed.

---

## Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts

Now I'll invoke the **discover_inputs protocol** to load all required content intelligently.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:27:36)

Good! All planning artifacts exist as whole files. Now loading content according to the discover_inputs protocol with SELECTIVE_LOAD strategy:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:27:56)

Perfect! I've loaded Epic 4 context. Now I'll extract Story 4.2 details and analyze related artifacts.

**Story 4.2 Foundation Extracted:**
- **User Story**: As a musician using Peach, I want the app to intelligently choose which comparisons to present, so that every comparison maximally improves my pitch discrimination
- **Key Requirements**: NextNoteStrategy protocol, AdaptiveNoteStrategy implementation, difficulty adjustment, weak spot targeting, Natural/Mechanical balance, cold start at 100 cents, fractional cent precision

Now loading previous story (4.1) for context continuity and git intelligence:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:28:17)

Excellent context! Now loading architecture and other planning artifacts for comprehensive analysis:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:28:42)

Perfect! I've now completed the comprehensive artifact analysis. Let me proceed with **Step 3: Architecture Analysis** and then create the story file.

## Step 3: Architecture Analysis Complete

**Key Architectural Requirements for Story 4.2:**

From architecture.md:
- **NextNoteStrategy Protocol** (line 152, 332): Returns Comparison (note1, note2, centDifference); reads profile & settings; no audio/UI awareness
- **AdaptiveNoteStrategy** (line 152): Implements NextNoteStrategy with weak-spot targeting and difficulty adjustment
- **Location**: Core/Algorithm/ directory (lines 205-207, 292-293)
- **Dependencies**: Reads PerceptualProfile (line 178); independent of NotePlayer and TrainingDataStore
- **Integration**: TrainingSession will use it in Story 4.3 (line 173)

**Service Boundaries** (lines 330-335):
- Boundary: reads profile, produces comparison
- No persistence, no UI, no audio playback

**Testing**: PeachTests/Core/Algorithm/AdaptiveNoteStrategyTests.swift (lines 317-318)

## Step 4: Web Research (Minimal - Native Swift)

Story 4.2 uses native Swift APIs and algorithmic logic. No external libraries or APIs requiring latest version research. Architecture specifies:
- Swift 6.2.3 (Xcode 26.3) - native language features
- SwiftUI @Observable pattern - already established in Story 4.1
- Swift Testing framework - already established

---

## Step 5: Create Comprehensive Story File

Now creating the ultimate developer guide for Story 4.2...

### 🤖 Assistant (17:32:11)

✅ **Story File Created Successfully!**

I've generated a comprehensive developer guide for Story 4.2 at:
`docs/implementation-artifacts/4-2-implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy.md`

**Story Summary:**
- **Story ID**: 4.2
- **Title**: Implement NextNoteStrategy Protocol and AdaptiveNoteStrategy
- **Epic**: 4 - Smart Training — Adaptive Algorithm
- **Status**: ready-for-dev

**Key Sections Generated:**

✅ **Story & Acceptance Criteria**: All 7 ACs from epics file
✅ **Tasks/Subtasks**: 7 major tasks with detailed subtasks covering protocol design, cold start, difficulty adjustment, weak spot targeting, settings integration, orchestration, and testing
✅ **Dev Notes**: 
  - Critical context explaining this is the "decision engine" of Peach
  - Epic 4 context and dependencies
  - Complete FR coverage (FR9-FR15)
  - Technical stack details
  
✅ **Architecture Compliance**: 
  - Service boundaries from architecture.md
  - Data flow documentation
  - File organization (Core/Algorithm/)
  - Naming conventions
  
✅ **Algorithm Deep Dive**:
  - Comparison data structure
  - Cold start algorithm (100 cents, random selection)
  - Difficulty adjustment (0.8x harder on correct, 1.3x easier on incorrect, 1-cent floor)
  - Weak spot targeting (Natural vs. Mechanical balance)
  - Settings integration
  
✅ **Learnings from Story 4.1**:
  - Protocol-based design patterns
  - @Observable usage (or not - decided internal state is sufficient)
  - Mock testing patterns
  - Swift 6 concurrency considerations
  
✅ **Integration Points**: PerceptualProfile interface, Settings interface, TrainingSession integration (Story 4.3)
✅ **Testing Strategy**: 8 detailed test cases with code examples covering all ACs
✅ **What NOT To Do**: Clear boundaries and scope limitations
✅ **FR Coverage Map**: Complete mapping of FR9-FR15 to implementation actions
✅ **Project Structure**: New directories and alignment with architecture
✅ **References**: Comprehensive source citations from all planning artifacts

---

According to the workflow, I should now ask you: **[c] Continue** to update sprint status, or would you like to review the story first?

### 🧑 Human (17:36:44)

I found an error in the work of the previous (review) agent. Can I exit this session, resume the previous agent, then resume this session?

### 🤖 Assistant (17:37:02)

Yes, absolutely! The current work is already saved, so you can safely exit and resume later.

**Current Status:**
✅ Story file created and saved: `4-2-implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy.md`
✅ All story content generated (we're at the template-output checkpoint)
⏸️ **Remaining**: Update sprint-status.yaml to mark story as "ready-for-dev"

**To Resume This Session Later:**
When you're ready to come back, simply run `/bmad-bmm-create-story` again. The workflow will detect that story 4-2 is still in "backlog" status and you can either:
- Let it continue with the next story (if you want to skip 4-2 sprint status update)
- Manually update the sprint-status.yaml file yourself (change `4-2-implement-nextnotestrategy-protocol-and-adaptivenotestrategy: backlog` to `ready-for-dev`)

**What Error Did You Find?**
If it's related to the story document I just created, I can fix it now before you exit. Or if it's in a previous story/artifact, you can go fix that first and come back here.

The story file is complete and ready - no work will be lost if you exit now.

### 🧑 Human (17:37:44)

It is related to the previous story. Can I use `claude --resume` for this purpose?

### 🤖 Assistant (17:38:07)

Great question! For your specific use case, here's how to handle it:

**Short Answer:** `claude --resume` resumes your last CLI conversation, but since you want to work on a *different* task (fixing story 4.1), you have a couple of better options:

**Option 1: Just Exit and Fix Manually**
1. Exit this conversation (Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D)
2. Edit the story 4.1 file directly: `4-1-implement-perceptualprofile.md`
3. When ready, run `/bmad-bmm-create-story` again to finish story 4.2 sprint status update

**Option 2: Exit, Start Fresh Conversation for Fix**
1. Exit this conversation
2. Start a new Claude Code session: `claude`
3. Ask Claude to fix the error in story 4.1
4. Exit that conversation when done
5. Start another session and run `/bmad-bmm-create-story` to continue

**Option 3: Fix It Right Now in This Conversation**
If the error is simple and you want me to fix it now, just tell me:
- What file needs fixing (e.g., `4-1-implement-perceptualprofile.md`)
- What the error is
- I can fix it immediately, then we'll continue with updating sprint-status for story 4.2

**About `claude --resume`:**
- It resumes your *last* conversation where you left off
- Useful for continuing the same task
- But for switching between different tasks (fix 4.1 vs. create 4.2), separate conversations are cleaner

**What would you prefer?** I can fix the story 4.1 error now if you tell me what needs changing, or you can exit and handle it separately.

### 🧑 Human (17:44:43)

Ok, you'll notice that there are some uncommitted changes left behind by the previous agent. These will need to be committed, but only after fixing the issue. The issue is, that TrainingSession still depending on HapticFeedback, although it should be just another observer. HapticFeedback does not conform to the necessary protocol yet. Also, `recordComparison` does not need the `isCorrect` parameter as this is already available through the comparison itself.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:44:53)

Got it! I'll fix those issues from the previous agent's work on Story 4.1. Let me examine the current state and make the corrections.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:45:46)

Perfect! Now I can see the issues clearly. Let me fix them:

1. **Create CompletedComparison struct** to bundle comparison + result
2. **Update ComparisonObserver** to use CompletedComparison (removes redundant isCorrect parameter)
3. **Make HapticFeedbackManager conform to ComparisonObserver**
4. **Remove hapticManager dependency** from TrainingSession

Let me implement these fixes:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:46:16)

Now let me update TrainingSession to remove the hapticManager dependency and use the new CompletedComparison:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:46:39)

Now I need to update the observer implementations. Let me check and update TrainingDataStore, PerceptualProfile, and PeachApp:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:47:14)

Now let me update the test files. Let me check the MockTrainingDataStore first:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:47:25)

Now let me check and update the test files that reference the old hapticManager parameter:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:47:41)

Now let me check and update the other test files:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:47:47)

Perfect! Now let me verify the build works and then commit all the fixes. Let me run a quick build check:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:48:01)

There's one more mock in TrainingScreen.swift that needs updating. Let me fix it:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:48:14)

Now let's rebuild to verify all fixes are correct:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:48:24)

I need to update MockHapticFeedbackManager to also conform to ComparisonObserver:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:48:53)

Perfect! The build succeeds. Now let me commit all the changes:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:49:19)

Perfect! ✅ All fixes completed and committed successfully!

## Summary of Architectural Improvements

**Commit:** `46372af` - "Refactor observer pattern: Remove redundant parameters and complete HapticFeedback integration"

## Next Steps

Would you like to:
1. **Resume the create-story workflow** to finish updating sprint-status.yaml for Story 4.2?
2. **Continue with something else** first?

The Story 4.2 file is ready and saved. All that's left is updating the sprint status from "backlog" to "ready-for-dev".

### 🧑 Human (17:51:09)

The latest commits contains changes that are completely unrelated: the refactoring and story 4.2. They need to be separated and put into two different commits.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:51:15)

You're absolutely right! Let me fix that by splitting the commit into two separate commits:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:51:37)

Now let me commit the refactoring changes first, then the Story 4.2 documentation separately:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:51:57)

Now let me commit the Story 4.2 documentation:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:52:16)

Perfect! ✅ Commits are now properly separated:

## Recent Commits:
1. **707eed2** - Create Story 4.2: Implement NextNoteStrategy Protocol and AdaptiveNoteStrategy
   - Story documentation only (768 lines added)

2. **15880a9** - Refactor observer pattern: Remove redundant parameters and complete HapticFeedback integration  
   - Code refactoring only (13 files changed)

3. **eab001d** - Refactor PerceptualProfile: Remove data store coupling
4. **80418f4** - Implement PerceptualProfile for adaptive training - Story 4.1

## Remaining Uncommitted:
- `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` (modified)

This file should be committed as part of completing the create-story workflow to mark Story 4.2 as "ready-for-dev".

---

Would you like to:
1. **Resume the create-story workflow** to finish updating sprint-status.yaml and commit it properly?
2. **Review the commits** before proceeding?
3. **Do something else** first?
