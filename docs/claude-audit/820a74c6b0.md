### 🤖 Assistant (00:07:57)

I'll start by loading the workflow system files.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:08:01)

Now let me load the config source and workflow components.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:08:14)

Good. I've loaded all workflow components. Now executing **Step 1: Determine target story**.

The user provided "7-2", so I'm parsing: `epic_num=7`, `story_num=2`. Let me load the sprint status and epics file to get the full story details.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:08:21)

**Step 1 Complete.** Found the target story:
- **Story Key:** `7-2-accessibility-audit-and-custom-component-labels`
- **Story ID:** 7.2
- **Status:** backlog
- **Epic 7** is already `in-progress`, no status change needed.

Now executing **Step 2: Load and analyze core artifacts** — running the `discover_inputs` protocol.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:08:33)

Good. Discovery results:
- ✓ Loaded epics content from `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`
- ✓ Found PRD at `docs/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
- ✓ Found Architecture at `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- ✓ Found UX design at `docs/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- ✓ Found previous story: `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-1-english-and-german-localization.md`
- ○ No project-context.md found

Now loading the previous story and architecture/UX documents for exhaustive analysis.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:08:39)

Now I have deep context from all artifacts. Let me analyze the current codebase to understand the exact state of custom components and their accessibility implementations.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:11:06)

Excellent. I now have comprehensive analysis of all artifacts. Let me summarize the discovery:

**Artifact Analysis Complete:**
- ✓ Loaded epics content — Epic 7, Story 7.2 full BDD criteria
- ✓ Loaded architecture — project structure, patterns, testing framework
- ✓ Loaded UX design — accessibility strategy, custom components, sensory hierarchy
- ✓ Loaded previous story (7.1) — localization patterns, file list, 239 tests passing
- ✓ Analyzed full codebase — all accessibility implementations, custom components, gaps
- ✓ Analyzed test structure — 240 tests across 15 files, 3 mock classes

**Key Finding: Most custom component accessibility labels are already implemented** from earlier stories (5.1, 5.3, 7.1). The remaining work focuses on:
1. Reduce Motion compliance (gap found)
2. Dynamic Type audit at extreme sizes
3. VoiceOver navigation completeness
4. Eyes-closed training verification
5. Targeted tests

Now executing **Step 5: Create comprehensive story file**.

I'll write the story header and story requirements first.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:13:43)

The story file has been written. Here's a summary of what was generated:

---

**Story 7.2: Accessibility Audit and Custom Component Labels**

**Key finding from codebase analysis:** Most custom component accessibility labels are already in place from Stories 5.1, 5.3, and 7.1. The primary code change needed is the **Reduce Motion fix**.

**7 Tasks:**

| # | Task | Type |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | Fix Reduce Motion compliance — add `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` to TrainingScreen | **Code change** |
| 2 | Audit Dynamic Type at AX1–AX5 sizes across all screens | Verification |
| 3 | Audit VoiceOver navigation on all 5 screens | Verification |
| 4 | Verify eyes-closed training loop | Verification |
| 5 | Verify color contrast in light/dark mode | Verification |
| 6 | Write tests for Reduce Motion behavior | **Code change** |
| 7 | Write comprehensive accessibility label tests | **Code change** |

**Only required code change:** The FeedbackIndicator animation in `TrainingScreen.swift:58` uses `.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2))` without checking `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`. The doc comment in `FeedbackIndicator.swift` claims Reduce Motion support that doesn't exist.

**What's already done (from earlier stories):** Profile visualization, profile preview, feedback indicator, and summary statistics all have proper accessibility labels with localized `String(localized:)` strings.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:13:58)

Now executing **Step 6: Update sprint status and finalize**.

Let me first validate the story, then update the sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:14:14)

The story has been saved. Now updating the sprint status.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:14:22)

Sprint status updated. Now let me commit both files.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:14:29)

I notice there's an unrelated modified file (`Localizable.xcstrings`). I'll only commit the story file and sprint status update.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:14:38)

**ULTIMATE BMad Method STORY CONTEXT CREATED, Michael!**

**Story Details:**
- **Story ID:** 7.2
- **Story Key:** 7-2-accessibility-audit-and-custom-component-labels
- **File:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/7-2-accessibility-audit-and-custom-component-labels.md`
- **Status:** ready-for-dev

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the comprehensive story in the file above
2. Run dev agents `dev-story` for optimized implementation
3. Run `code-review` when complete (auto-marks done)

**The developer now has everything needed for flawless implementation!**
