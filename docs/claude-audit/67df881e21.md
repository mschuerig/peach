Hey Michael! 🏃 Bob here, your Scrum Master.

Ready to keep things moving and stories sharp. Here's what I can help you with:

1. **[MH]** Redisplay Menu Help
2. **[CH]** Chat with the Agent about anything
3. **[SP]** Sprint Planning — Generate or update the task sequence for the dev agent to follow
4. **[CS]** Context Story — Prepare a story with all required context for implementation
5. **[ER]** Epic Retrospective — Party Mode review of all work completed across an epic
6. **[CC]** Course Correction — Determine how to proceed when major changes are discovered mid-implementation
7. **[PM]** Start Party Mode
8. **[DA]** Dismiss Agent

You can type `/bmad-help` at any time to get advice on what to do next. You can combine it with what you need help with, e.g. `/bmad-help where should I start with an idea I have that does XYZ`

What would you like to do?

### 🤖 Assistant (14:52:29)

Alright Michael, let's kick off Sprint Planning! Loading the workflow components now.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:52:35)

Good, all workflow components loaded. Now executing **Step 0.5 — Discover and Load Project Documents**.

Let me find all epic files in your planning artifacts folder.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:52:40)

Found the whole document: `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`. Loading it now.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:53:02)

**Discovery Results:**
- ✓ Loaded `{epics_content}` from 1 file: `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`

Now executing **Step 1 — Parse epic files and extract all work items**.

I've parsed all epics and stories from the file. Here's the complete inventory:

| Epic | Stories |
|------|---------|
| **Epic 1:** Remember Every Note — Data Foundation | 1.1 Create Xcode Project and Folder Structure, 1.2 Implement ComparisonRecord Data Model and TrainingDataStore |
| **Epic 2:** Hear and Compare — Core Audio Engine | 2.1 Implement NotePlayer Protocol and SineWaveNotePlayer, 2.2 Support Configurable Note Duration and Reference Pitch |
| **Epic 3:** Train Your Ear — The Comparison Loop | 3.1 Start Screen and Navigation Shell, 3.2 TrainingSession State Machine and Comparison Loop, 3.3 Training Screen UI with Higher/Lower Buttons and Feedback, 3.4 Training Interruption and App Lifecycle Handling |
| **Epic 4:** Smart Training — Adaptive Algorithm | 4.1 Implement PerceptualProfile, 4.2 Implement NextNoteStrategy Protocol and AdaptiveNoteStrategy, 4.3 Integrate Adaptive Algorithm into TrainingSession |
| **Epic 5:** See Your Progress — Profile & Statistics | 5.1 Profile Screen with Perceptual Profile Visualization, 5.2 Summary Statistics with Trend Indicator, 5.3 Profile Preview on Start Screen and Navigation |
| **Epic 6:** Make It Yours — Settings & Configuration | 6.1 Settings Screen with All Configuration Options, 6.2 Apply Settings to Training in Real Time |
| **Epic 7:** Polish & Ship — Platform, Localization & Info | 7.1 English and German Localization, 7.2 Accessibility Audit and Custom Component Labels, 7.3 iPhone iPad Portrait and Landscape Support, 7.4 Info Screen |

**Totals:** 7 epics, 20 stories

Now moving to **Step 2 & 3 — Build sprint status structure and detect existing statuses**. Let me check for any existing story files and a previous sprint-status.yaml.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:53:07)

No existing story files or sprint-status.yaml found. All items start at `backlog` / `optional` status.

Now executing **Step 4 — Generate sprint status file**.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:56:47)

Now executing **Step 5 — Validate and report**.

**Validation Checklist:**
- [x] Every epic in epic files appears in sprint-status.yaml (7/7)
- [x] Every story in epic files appears in sprint-status.yaml (20/20)
- [x] Every epic has a corresponding retrospective entry (7/7)
- [x] No items in sprint-status.yaml that don't exist in epic files
- [x] All status values are legal (backlog, optional)
- [x] File is valid YAML syntax

**Sprint Status Generated Successfully**

- **File Location:** `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
- **Total Epics:** 7
- **Total Stories:** 20
- **Epics In Progress:** 0
- **Stories Completed:** 0

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the generated `sprint-status.yaml`
2. Use **[CS] Context Story** to prepare your first story for implementation (Story 1.1 — Create Xcode Project and Folder Structure)
3. Agents will update statuses as they work
4. Re-run Sprint Planning anytime to refresh auto-detected statuses

The board is clean and ready, Michael. Want to jump into creating the first story, or anything else?

### 🧑 Human (14:58:16)

Go ahead.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:58:19)

Let's create the first story. Loading the Create Story workflow now.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:58:32)

**Step 1 — Determine target story.**

From the sprint-status.yaml, the first backlog story is:
- **Story 1.1:** `1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure`
- **Epic 1:** Remember Every Note — Data Foundation

This is the first story in Epic 1, so I'm updating Epic 1 from `backlog` → `in-progress`.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:58:37)

Now executing **Step 2 & 3 — Exhaustive artifact analysis**. Loading all source documents in parallel.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:59:20)

All artifacts analyzed. Let me also check git history for recent patterns.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:59:27)

No project-context.md exists yet and no implementation code has been committed — this is a greenfield project. All prior commits are planning artifacts only.

Now executing **Step 5 — Create comprehensive story file**. Writing the complete story with all context the dev agent needs.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:00:14)

Story file created. Now executing **Step 6 — Update sprint status and finalize**.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:00:26)

- **Status:** ready-for-dev

**Sprint Status Updated:**
- `epic-1`: backlog → **in-progress**

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the story at `docs/implementation-artifacts/1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure.md`
2. Run dev agent's `dev-story` for implementation
3. Run `code-review` when complete

Want me to do anything else, or are you ready to hand this off to the dev agent?

### 🧑 Human (15:10:09)

First, before handing of to another agent, commit all changes.

### 🤖 Assistant (15:10:17)

Two new untracked files in `docs/implementation-artifacts/`:
- `sprint-status.yaml`
- `1-1-create-xcode-project-and-folder-structure.md`

### 🤖 Assistant (15:10:33)

Committed `67df881`. Working tree is clean. Branch is 1 commit ahead of origin (not pushed).

Ready to hand off to the dev agent whenever you are, Michael.

### 🧑 Human (15:11:07)

How can I ensure that changes are committed after earch meaningful task is completed?
