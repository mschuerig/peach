## Commit message

Add interval training variants to PRD (v0.3 scope) and validation report

Extend PRD with interval-based training modes that generalize both comparison
and pitch matching from unison to arbitrary musical intervals. Adds interval
domain model (tuning systems, interval value object), two new user journeys,
15 new FRs (FR53-FR67), and v0.3 phase scoping. Initial implementation
targets a single fixed interval: perfect fifth up.

Includes full PRD validation report (12-step BMAD workflow).

### 🧑 Human (00:36:11)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-edit-prd</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-edit-prd</command-name>
<command-args>I want to introduce a variant to each of the existing training types. Currently, they are concerned with the pitch of one target note: either to decide whether a second note is higher/lower, or to match the target note. In both cases, the target note is played first. Here's the variation I want to introduce:

Comparison Training: Given a musical interval. note1 is played. note2 is played at the given interval _plus_ a signed cent difference (as before). The user's task is to judge whether note2 was higher or lower.

Pitch Matching Training: The reference note is played. The user has to adjust the second note to match a given interval.

There are some extensions I can think of that we will need:

* An Interval value object for representing intervals from Prime through Octave.
* Settings for choosing which intervals are to be used in training; separate for up and down direction. Here we will need to do some UI design for the view.
* Several datastructure will have to be extended.
* Several of the training classes/methods will need to take a parameter with a set of available intervals.
* On the start screen, these training variants should get two new buttons. The existing buttons should use the same underlying training sessions and screen, just fixed to a prime interval.

We will have to introduce Tuning Systems. For a start, we can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament (in fact that is what we are implicitly using now), but we need to support more. At least Just Intonation.

I'd like to get a usable and testable implementation quickly, so we should start with a single, fixed interval: perfect fifth up.</command-args>

I'll start by loading the workflow file as instructed.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:36:24)

**Edit Mode: Improving an existing PRD.**

Which PRD would you like to edit? Please provide the path to the PRD.md file.

Let me help by finding existing PRDs in the project.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:36:28)

I found one PRD at `docs/planning-artifacts/prd.md`. Is this the one you'd like to edit, Michael?

### 🧑 Human (00:37:54)

yes

### 🤖 Assistant (00:37:56)

Reading the PRD and loading the first edit workflow step.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:38:22)

No validation report found in the PRD folder.

**Do you have a validation report to guide edits?**

If you've run the validation workflow on this PRD, I can use that report to guide improvements and prioritize changes.

Validation report path (or type 'none'):

### 🧑 Human (00:41:43)

none

### 🤖 Assistant (00:41:55)

Proceeding with manual edit discovery.

Now, let me confirm my understanding of your edit requirements. You've already described them in detail — let me summarize what I've captured:

**Edit Requirements Understood**

**PRD Format:** BMAD Standard (6/6 core sections present)
**Validation Guide:** None

**Edit Goals — Interval Training Variants:**

1. **New training paradigm: Interval-based variants** of both existing training types:
   - **Interval Comparison:** Given a musical interval — note1 plays, note2 plays at the target interval ± a signed cent difference — user judges higher/lower relative to the expected interval
   - **Interval Pitch Matching:** Reference note plays — user adjusts second note to match a given interval above/below the reference

2. **New domain concepts needed:**
   - Interval value object (Prime through Octave)
   - Tuning Systems (starting with 12-TET, with Just Intonation planned)
   - Interval selection settings (per direction: up/down)

3. **UI/UX impact:**
   - Two new Start Screen buttons for the interval variants
   - Existing buttons reuse the same underlying training sessions, fixed to Prime (unison)
   - New settings UI for interval selection

4. **Implementation strategy:** Start with a single fixed interval (perfect fifth up) to get a usable/testable implementation quickly, then generalize

**Proceeding to deep review and analysis...**

Let me load the next step.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:42:37)

Now I'll perform a deep review and build a change plan. Let me analyze the PRD systematically against your edit requirements.

---

**Deep Review Complete — Change Plan**

**PRD Analysis:**
The PRD is well-structured BMAD Standard format with clean traceability from executive summary through functional requirements. It currently defines two training paradigms (Comparison, Pitch Matching) operating on single-pitch perception. Your request introduces a significant new dimension: interval-based training, which cross-cuts both existing paradigms and introduces new domain concepts (intervals, tuning systems).

**Your Edit Requirements:**
Add interval-based variants of both training types, introduce Interval and Tuning System domain concepts, add Start Screen buttons, extend settings and data models.

---

**Proposed Change Plan — By Section:**

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Current State:** Describes two modes operating on single-pitch perception
- **Change Needed:** Expand to mention that both modes can operate on intervals (not just unison). Add the concept that unison is simply the "prime" interval case.
- **Priority:** High

### 2. Success Criteria
- **Current State:** Focuses on cent difference thresholds and pitch matching accuracy
- **Change Needed:** Add success criteria for interval training — measurable improvement in detecting intonation deviations within intervals, and matching intervals accurately
- **Priority:** Medium

### 3. Project Scoping & Phased Development
- **Current State:** MVP (Phase 1) + v0.2 (Pitch Matching) + Future Ideas
- **Change Needed:** Add **v0.3 scope (Phase 3 — Interval Training)** covering:
  - Interval value object (Prime through Octave)
  - Tuning systems (12-TET initially, Just Intonation planned)
  - Interval Comparison and Interval Pitch Matching training modes
  - Start Screen integration (two new buttons)
  - Existing modes reframed as prime/unison interval case
  - Initial implementation: fixed perfect fifth up
  - Settings for interval selection (per direction) as a subsequent step
- **Priority:** Critical

### 4. User Journeys
- **Current State:** 6 journeys (First Launch, Daily Training, Progress, Return, Settings, Pitch Matching)
- **Change Needed:** Add two new journeys:
  - **Journey 7: Interval Comparison** — user trains to detect pitch deviations within a given interval
  - **Journey 8: Interval Pitch Matching** — user adjusts a note to match a target interval from a reference
  - Update **Journey 5 (Settings)** to mention interval selection settings
- **Priority:** Critical

### 5. Journey Requirements Summary Table
- **Change Needed:** Add rows for interval training capabilities (interval comparison, interval pitch matching, interval settings, tuning system selection)
- **Priority:** High

### 6. Mobile App Specific Requirements / Architecture
- **Current State:** Protocol-based audio engine, per-comparison and per-pitch-matching data models
- **Change Needed:** Add Interval value object, Tuning System concept, extended data models for interval-based results (recording the target interval alongside existing fields)
- **Priority:** High

### 7. Functional Requirements
- **Change Needed:** Add new FRs for:
  - **Interval domain:** Interval value object, tuning system abstraction
  - **Interval Comparison:** Training loop variant with interval context
  - **Interval Pitch Matching:** Matching variant with interval target
  - **Start Screen:** Two new buttons for interval variants
  - **Settings:** Interval selection (per direction), tuning system selection
  - **Data persistence:** Extended records for interval-based results
  - Clarify that existing comparison/matching modes are the prime-interval case
- **Priority:** Critical

### 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Current State:** Performance, accessibility, data integrity
- **Change Needed:** Add tuning system calculation precision requirement (frequency computation for intervals in different tuning systems must be accurate to within 0.1 cent)
- **Priority:** Low

---

**Changes by Type:**
- **Additions:** 2 new journeys, ~12-15 new FRs, 1 new phase scope section, tuning system NFR
- **Updates:** 5 existing sections (Exec Summary, Success Criteria, Journey 5, Journey Req Summary, Architecture)
- **Removals:** None
- **Restructuring:** No

**Priority Distribution:**
- **Critical:** 3 changes (Scoping, Journeys, Functional Requirements)
- **High:** 3 changes (Exec Summary, Journey Req Summary, Architecture)
- **Medium:** 1 change (Success Criteria)
- **Low:** 1 change (NFR precision)

**Estimated Effort:** Moderate

---

**Questions:**
1. Does this change plan align with what you had in mind?
2. Any sections I should add/remove/reprioritize?
3. Should the "existing modes = prime interval" reframing appear in the PRD as a design note, or should I actually restructure the existing FR descriptions to use interval language?

**Review the plan and let me know if you'd like any adjustments.**

### 🧑 Human (00:47:56)

Regarding 3: Leave the descriptions of the existing training modes as they are. Describe the newly introduced training modes as generalizations and refer back to the previous descriptions.

### 🤖 Assistant (00:48:04)

Good approach — keeps the existing FRs clean and stable, and positions the interval modes as generalizations that reference them. No duplication, clear lineage.

**Updated approach for Functional Requirements:**
- Existing FR1-FR8 (Comparison) and FR44-FR52 (Pitch Matching) remain untouched
- New interval FRs reference back: e.g., "As FR2, but note2 is played at the target interval ± the cent difference" or "Generalizes FR46 — user adjusts to match a target interval rather than unison"

Anything else you'd like to adjust, or shall I proceed with the edits?

Performing traceability validation...

**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** Intact ✓
All success criteria (profile narrowing, low-friction loop, matching accuracy, statistics, interval improvement) align with the vision of pitch training through comparison + matching + interval variants.

**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** Intact ✓
Each success criterion maps to at least one journey (profile narrowing→J3, low-friction→J1/J2, matching→J6, interval→J7/J8, regular return→J4).

**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** Intact ✓
All 8 journeys have supporting FRs. J7→FR56-FR59, J8→FR60-FR64.

**Scope → FR Alignment:** Intact ✓
MVP FRs (FR1-FR43) align with Phase 1, v0.2 FRs (FR44-FR52) with Phase 2, v0.3 FRs (FR53-FR67) with Phase 3.

**Orphan check:** Infrastructure FRs (audio engine FR16-FR20, data persistence FR27-FR29, localization FR37-FR38, device/platform FR39-FR41) are cross-cutting and support all journeys. FR43 (Info Screen) traces to scope but has no dedicated journey narrative — minor observation only.

| Format | BMAD Standard (6/6) |
| Information Density | Pass (0 violations) |
| Product Brief Coverage | N/A (no brief) |
| Measurability | Critical (15 violations, many marginal) |

| Project-Type Compliance | Pass (100%) |
| SMART Quality | Pass (94% acceptable) |
| Holistic Quality | 4/5 — Good |
| Completeness | Pass (100%) |

**Critical Issues:** None (measurability flagged as "critical" by threshold but most violations are marginal — subjective terms backed by implicit metrics)

**Warnings:** 4 implementation leakage items in new interval FRs (FR53, FR55, FR59/FR63, FR66)

**Strengths:**
- Proven PRD — already drove successful UX design, architecture, and 20 epics of implementation
- Strong traceability chain (vision → journeys → FRs)
- Zero information density violations
- New v0.3 interval content integrates cleanly into existing structure

**Holistic Quality:** 4/5 — Good

**Top 3 Improvements:**
1. Reframe FR55 and FR66 as observable behaviors, not architecture directives
2. Add specific metrics to NFR-Perf-2 (comparison transition latency) and NFR-Access-2 (WCAG AA ratios)
3. Resolve cross-reference pattern in FR59/FR63 — expand or document as accepted convention

**Recommendation:** PRD is in good shape and ready for downstream use. Address the implementation leakage in the new interval FRs and two NFR metric gaps to make it great.
