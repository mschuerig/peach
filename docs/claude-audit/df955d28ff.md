## Commit message

Add implementation readiness report and fix planning artifact issues

Readiness assessment found 100% FR coverage across 7 epics and 20
stories with no blockers. Three minor issues fixed:
- Correct FR count in architecture (42 → 44 including FR7a, FR43)
- Remove ambiguous Settings sheet mention in UX spec
- Reframe Epic 1 with user-centric title and description

### 🤖 Assistant (14:33:21)

Now let me load and follow the first step.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:33:34)

Beginning **Document Discovery** to inventory all project files.

I will:

1. Search for all required documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX)
2. Group sharded documents together
3. Identify any duplicates (whole + sharded versions)
4. Present findings for your confirmation

Let me search for all document types now.

**Select an Option:** **[C]** Continue to PRD Analysis

### 🧑 Human (14:37:30)

c

### 🤖 Assistant (14:37:34)

Let me initialize the report from the template, then proceed to the next step.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:38:10)

Now loading step 2.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:38:14)

Beginning **PRD Analysis** to extract all requirements.

I will:

1. Load the PRD document
2. Read it completely and thoroughly
3. Extract ALL Functional Requirements (FRs)
4. Extract ALL Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
5. Document findings for coverage validation

### 🤖 Assistant (14:38:19)

PRD fully loaded and read. Now extracting all requirements and appending to the report.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:39:17)

PRD analysis complete. **44 Functional Requirements** and **12 Non-Functional Requirements** extracted and documented. Now loading Step 3 for epic coverage validation.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:39:22)

Beginning **Epic Coverage Validation**.

I will:

1. Load the epics and stories document
2. Extract FR coverage information
3. Compare against PRD FRs from previous step
4. Identify any FRs not covered in epics

### 🤖 Assistant (14:39:34)

Epics document fully loaded and read. Now performing the coverage analysis.

All 44 FRs from the PRD are present in the epics FR Coverage Map. Let me update the report.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:40:01)

**Epic Coverage Validation complete.** All 44 FRs have 100% traceable coverage across 7 epics and 17 stories. No missing requirements, no orphaned FRs.

Now loading Step 4 for UX alignment.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:40:07)

Beginning **UX Alignment** validation.

I will:

1. Check if UX documentation exists
2. Validate alignment with PRD and Architecture
3. Document findings

UX document was found in Step 1: `docs/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`. Let me read it fully, along with the architecture doc, to validate alignment.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:40:31)

Both documents fully read. Now validating alignment.

**UX ↔ PRD Alignment Analysis:**

All five user journeys in UX match PRD journeys exactly. UX covers all screens (Start, Training, Profile, Settings, Info), all interaction patterns (comparison loop, feedback, interruption handling), and all design constraints (no gamification, no sessions, no onboarding). The UX sensory hierarchy (ears > fingers > eyes) directly supports the PRD's "training, not testing" philosophy. No PRD requirements are missing from UX.

**UX ↔ Architecture Alignment Analysis:**

The architecture supports all UX requirements:
- NavigationStack for hub-and-spoke navigation
- SwiftUI Canvas + Swift Charts for profile visualization
- AVAudioEngine for audio with <10ms latency
- @AppStorage for immediate settings persistence
- @Observable for TrainingSession state machine
- SwiftData for comparison record persistence

**Issues Found:**

1. **Minor discrepancy:** The Architecture document's validation section references "42 FRs (FR1–FR42)" but the PRD actually contains 44 FRs (FR1–FR43 plus FR7a). FR43 (Info Screen) and FR7a (return to Start Screen on foreground) appear to be undercounted in the architecture's final tally. Both are architecturally supported, just miscounted.

2. **Minor ambiguity in UX:** The Settings Screen presentation is noted as "potentially" a `.sheet()` in the component table, while the navigation patterns section specifies push navigation via NavigationStack. The stories (Epic 6, Story 6.1) specify "back navigation or swipe" which implies push, not sheet. This should be clarified as push navigation for consistency.

Let me update the report and proceed.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:41:00)

**UX Alignment Assessment complete.** Strong alignment across all three documents with only two minor cosmetic issues noted. Now loading Step 5 for epic quality review.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:41:34)

Beginning **Epic Quality Review** against create-epics-and-stories standards.

I will rigorously validate:

- Epics deliver user value (not technical milestones)
- Epic independence (Epic 2 doesn't need Epic 3)
- Story dependencies (no forward references)
- Proper story sizing and completeness

Any deviation from best practices will be flagged as a defect.

Let me now systematically review each epic and story from the epics document I already loaded.

---

### Epic Structure Validation

**Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Data**
- Title: "Project Foundation & Core Data" — this is a **technical milestone**, not user-centric. A user doesn't "establish the Xcode project and folder structure."
- Goal: "...so that training data can be reliably stored and retrieved" — developer value, not user value.
- Stories: 1.1 is pure project setup, 1.2 is data model + persistence.
- **Verdict:** This epic has no direct user value — it's infrastructure. However, it is the foundational layer everything depends on. In practice, for a greenfield project, a "foundation" epic is a common pragmatic exception. The architecture explicitly requires this as the first implementation step.

**Epic 2: Hear and Compare — Core Audio Engine**
- Title: User-centric ("Users can hear precisely generated tones")
- Stories deliver testable audio capability
- **Verdict:** User value is clear — without this, no training is possible.

**Epic 3: Train Your Ear — The Comparison Loop**
- Title: Fully user-centric
- This is the core product experience
- **Verdict:** Strong user value. Central epic.

**Epic 4: Smart Training — Adaptive Algorithm**
- Title: "Smart Training" — user-centric framing of an algorithmic capability
- Goal describes intelligent comparison selection perceived by the user
- **Verdict:** User value is indirect but real — the user experiences smarter training.

**Epic 5: See Your Progress — Profile & Statistics**
- Title: Fully user-centric
- **Verdict:** Clear user value.

**Epic 6: Make It Yours — Settings & Configuration**
- Title: User-centric
- **Verdict:** Clear user value.

**Epic 7: Polish & Ship — Platform, Localization & Info**
- Title: Partially user-centric
- **Verdict:** User value through accessibility, localization, device support.

### Epic Independence Validation

- **Epic 1:** Stands alone (project setup + data model). No dependencies.
- **Epic 2:** Depends on Epic 1 only for project structure. Audio engine is independent of data. **Valid.**
- **Epic 3:** Story 3.2 (TrainingSession) explicitly uses "random comparisons at 100 cents as a temporary placeholder until Epic 4." This means Epic 3 can function without Epic 4. **However**, Story 3.2 depends on Epic 2 (NotePlayer) and Epic 1 (TrainingDataStore). **Valid chain: 1 → 2 → 3.**
- **Epic 4:** Depends on Epic 1 (TrainingDataStore for PerceptualProfile) and integrates into Epic 3's TrainingSession. Story 4.3 explicitly replaces the random placeholder from Epic 3. **Valid: 1 → 4, integrates with 3.**
- **Epic 5:** Depends on Epic 1 (stored data) and Epic 4 (PerceptualProfile). Story 5.3 depends on Start Screen from Epic 3. **Valid chain.**
- **Epic 6:** Depends on Epic 3 (TrainingSession reads settings). Story 6.2 references AdaptiveNoteStrategy from Epic 4. **Issue: Story 6.2 has forward dependency on Epic 4 being complete, but Epic 6 is numbered after Epic 4. Valid ordering.**
- **Epic 7:** Depends on all prior epics (localization, accessibility, device testing across all screens). **Valid: final polish epic.**

**No forward dependencies detected.** Epics are properly ordered.

### Story Quality Assessment

**Story sizing:** All stories are appropriately sized — each delivers a testable increment. No mega-stories.

**Acceptance criteria review (all stories):**

| Story | Given/When/Then | Testable | Complete | Specific |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 1.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3.3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3.4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 4.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 4.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 4.3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 5.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 5.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 5.3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 6.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 6.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7.3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 7.4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

All 20 stories use proper Given/When/Then BDD format with testable, specific criteria.

### Database/Entity Creation Timing

Story 1.2 creates the ComparisonRecord @Model and TrainingDataStore. This is the only data entity in the app. Created exactly when first needed (Epic 1, the foundation). No premature schema creation. **Valid.**

### Starter Template Requirement

Architecture specifies: "Create Xcode 26.3 project → iOS → App → SwiftUI lifecycle, Swift language, SwiftData storage." Story 1.1 matches exactly: "Create Xcode Project and Folder Structure." **Valid.**

Now let me document all findings in the report.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:42:09)

**Epic Quality Review complete.** No critical or major issues found. One minor concern (Epic 1 as technical foundation) acknowledged as pragmatically acceptable. All 20 stories pass quality validation. Now loading Step 6 for the final assessment.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:42:15)

Completing **Final Assessment**.

I will now:

1. Review all findings from previous steps
2. Provide a comprehensive summary
3. Add specific recommendations
4. Determine overall readiness status

**Implementation Readiness Assessment Complete**

Report generated: `docs/planning-artifacts/implementation-readiness-report-2026-02-12.md`

### Results at a glance:

- **Status: READY**
- **Critical issues: 0**
- **Major issues: 0**
- **Minor issues: 3** (all cosmetic/optional)
- **FR coverage: 100%** (44/44)
- **Story quality: 20/20** pass all validation checks

The assessment found no blockers to implementation. Your planning artifacts are thorough, well-aligned, and ready to go. You can proceed directly to Epic 1, Story 1.1 — creating the Xcode project and folder structure.

### 🧑 Human (14:43:35)

Before continuing, fix the 3 issues you found.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:43:41)

Let me read the specific sections that need fixing.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:43:46)

Now let me apply all three fixes.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:43:53)

Now fix issue 3 — reframe Epic 1 to be user-value oriented.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:44:02)

Now update the Epic List summary entry too.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:44:11)

There's a second occurrence at line 188 that uses `##` (h2) instead of `###` (h3). Let me fix that one too.

### 🤖 Assistant (14:44:18)

All three fixes applied:

1. **architecture.md** — Updated FR count from "42 FRs (FR1–FR42)" to "44 FRs (FR1–FR43 plus FR7a)" in both locations
2. **ux-design-specification.md** — Removed "potentially Settings" from the sheet presentation row, clarifying that only the Info Screen uses `.sheet()`
3. **epics.md** — Reframed Epic 1 from "Project Foundation & Core Data" to "Remember Every Note — Data Foundation" with a user-value-oriented description (no training is ever lost)

### 🧑 Human (14:45:57)
