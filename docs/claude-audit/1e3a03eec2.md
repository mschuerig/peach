## Commit message

Create Story 3.3: Training Screen UI with Higher/Lower Buttons and Feedback

Story 3.3 adds visual and haptic feedback to complete the core training UX.

Key requirements:
- Add rounded rectangle corners (12pt radius) to Higher/Lower buttons (user request)
- Implement FeedbackIndicator component (thumbs up/down, green/red)
- Implement haptic feedback on incorrect answers (UIImpactFeedbackGenerator)
- No haptic on correct (silence = confirmation)
- Enable eyes-closed training via audio + haptic channels

Story context includes:
- Comprehensive UX analysis (sensory hierarchy: ears > fingers > eyes)
- Previous story intelligence (Story 3.2 already has feedback state)
- Architecture compliance requirements
- Implementation sequence and timing requirements
- User accessibility via haptic feedback

Status: ready-for-dev

### 🧑 Human (17:51:40)

<command-message>bmad-bmm-create-story</command-message>
<command-name>/bmad-bmm-create-story</command-name>

### 🤖 Assistant (17:51:44)

I'll help you create a new story following the BMAD workflow. Let me start by loading the workflow engine and configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:51:52)

Now I'll execute the workflow according to the workflow engine. Let me start by loading the configuration and required components.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:52:09)

Perfect! I've loaded the workflow configuration and instructions. Now I'll execute the workflow to create your story.

## 📋 Step 1: Determining Target Story

Let me load the sprint status to find the next backlog story:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:52:26)

Great! I found the next backlog story:

**Target Story:** 3-3-training-screen-ui-with-higher-lower-buttons-and-feedback
- Epic: 3
- Story: 3
- Story ID: 3.3

Since this is story 3 in an already in-progress epic (epic-3 is in-progress), I'll proceed to load and analyze artifacts.

## 📚 Step 2: Loading Core Artifacts (discover_inputs protocol)

### 🤖 Assistant (17:52:34)

Perfect! Found all planning artifacts. Now loading them:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:52:46)

Perfect! Now let me get recent git intelligence:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:53:17)

Excellent! I've loaded all artifacts and completed discovery. Now I'll create the comprehensive story file for Story 3.3.

## 📊 Discovery Results:

✓ Loaded **epics_content** from 1 file: epics.md
✓ Loaded **architecture_content** from 1 file: architecture.md  
✓ Loaded **ux_content** from 1 file: ux-design-specification.md
✓ Loaded **previous_story** from: 3-2-trainingsession-state-machine-and-comparison-loop.md
✓ Recent commits analyzed (10 commits)

Now creating the ultimate story context file for **Story 3.3: Training Screen UI with Higher/Lower Buttons and Feedback**...

### 🧑 Human (17:55:42)

I think it is mostly implemented already. I have a wish for the answer buttons: Their outline should be changed to rounded rectangles with small radii at the corners.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:55:48)

Ah, thank you for letting me know! Let me check the current Training Screen implementation to see what's already there:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:55:54)

Perfect! I can see the Training Screen is already implemented. Let me update the button shapes to use rounded rectangles with small corner radii as you requested:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:56:17)

Perfect! I've updated both the Higher and Lower buttons to use rounded rectangles with a corner radius of 12 points. The buttons now have `.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))` applied, which will give them nicely rounded corners while keeping them large and thumb-friendly.

Since Story 3.3 is mostly implemented, would you like me to:
1. **Mark Story 3.3 as done** and update the sprint status
2. **Commit these button shape changes** 
3. **Create the next story** (Story 3.4 or continue with the backlog)

What would you prefer?

### 🧑 Human (17:59:08)

We ought to go at least through the motions. So revert the code changes an continue with writing the story for 3.3. Leave implementation to the next step.

### 🤖 Assistant (17:59:13)

You're absolutely right! Let me revert those changes and complete the story creation process properly:

### 🤖 Assistant (17:59:26)

Good! Code reverted. Now let me continue creating the comprehensive Story 3.3 document:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:02:41)

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Story 3.3 document with:

✅ **Complete story context** - Epic background, why this story matters, user impact
✅ **Detailed technical requirements** - Architecture compliance, UX specifications
✅ **Previous story intelligence** - Learnings from Story 3.2 (state machine already has feedback state)
✅ **Implementation guidance** - Step-by-step sequence, what NOT to do, timing requirements
✅ **User request captured** - Rounded rectangle button corners with 12pt radius
✅ **Comprehensive references** - All sources cited with specific line numbers

Now let me update the sprint status to mark Story 3.3 as "ready-for-dev":

### 🤖 Assistant (18:02:52)

Perfect! Now let me commit these changes:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:03:13)

## ✅ Story 3.3 Created Successfully!

**Story Details:**
- **Story ID:** 3.3
- **Story Key:** 3-3-training-screen-ui-with-higher-lower-buttons-and-feedback
- **File:** docs/implementation-artifacts/3-3-training-screen-ui-with-higher-lower-buttons-and-feedback.md
- **Status:** ready-for-dev

**What's Included:**

🎯 **Core Requirements:**
- Add rounded rectangle corners (12pt radius) to Higher/Lower buttons (your request!)
- Implement visual feedback indicator (thumbs up/down, green/red)
- Implement haptic feedback on incorrect answers
- No haptic on correct (silence = confirmation)
- Complete the "ears > fingers > eyes" sensory hierarchy

📚 **Comprehensive Context:**
- **Previous Story Intelligence**: Story 3.2 already has the `showingFeedback` state and 400ms timing - Story 3.3 just needs to display feedback during that state
- **User Request Captured**: Rounded button corners with small radii (12pt) clearly documented
- **Architecture Analysis**: Component design, state management patterns, SwiftUI integration
- **UX Requirements**: Eyes-closed training via haptic feedback, emotional neutrality principle
- **Implementation Sequence**: 9-step guide with time estimates (~2.5 hours total)
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, device testing (haptics don't work in simulator), accessibility tests

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the story file: `docs/implementation-artifacts/3-3-training-screen-ui-with-higher-lower-buttons-and-feedback.md`
2. Run `/dev-story` or your dev workflow to implement
3. Test on real device (haptics require physical iPhone/iPad)

Would you like me to proceed with implementation, or would you prefer to review the story first?
