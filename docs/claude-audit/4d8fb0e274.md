### 🤖 Assistant (18:08:46)

I'll start by loading the workflow engine and the code review workflow configuration.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:08:52)

Now let me load the config source and the instructions file.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:09:05)

Good. I've loaded the workflow engine, config, instructions, and checklist. All variables are resolved:

- **User:** Michael
- **Language:** English
- **Skill Level:** intermediate
- **Planning Artifacts:** `docs/planning-artifacts`
- **Implementation Artifacts:** `docs/implementation-artifacts`
- **Template:** false (action-workflow — no output file)
- **Date:** 2026-02-22

This is an **adversarial code review** workflow. I need to find 3-10 specific problems — no lazy "looks good" reviews.

---

**Step 1: Load story and discover changes**

No `{{story_path}}` was provided. Let me find available story files.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:09:12)

The working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes). Here are the available story files:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:09:48)

Loading the story file and discovering changes.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:09:54)

Good. Story loaded. Let me now discover the actual git changes for this story and load the project context and architecture docs.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:10:02)

Let me check for architecture docs with other patterns and load all the actual source files.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:10:09)

Now let me check the Localizable.xcstrings changes and the test helpers referenced in the tests.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:10:16)

Let me check a few more things to build the complete review picture.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:12:15)

I now have a complete picture. Let me finalize my review.

---

**Step 1 Complete.** Here's what I found:

- **Story key:** `display-current-difficulty-on-training-screen`
- **Story status:** `review`
- **Commits:** `c4d2c2b` (implementation) on top of `e8c8039` (story creation)

**Git vs Story File List discrepancy:**
- `Peach/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` is in git diff but **NOT in the story File List**

---

**Step 2: Review attack plan built.** 5 ACs to validate, 5 tasks (all marked [x]) to audit, code quality deep dive on 6 changed files.

---

**Step 3: Executing adversarial review.** I've read every file. Here are my findings:

---

## **CODE REVIEW FINDINGS, Michael!**

**Story:** `display-current-difficulty-on-training-screen.md`
**Git vs Story Discrepancies:** 1 found
**Issues Found:** 1 High, 4 Medium, 3 Low

---

### CRITICAL / HIGH ISSUES

**H1: Force unwrap violates project "No force unwrapping (`!`)" rule**
`Peach/Training/TrainingSession.swift:262`

```swift
if sessionBestCentDifference == nil || diff < sessionBestCentDifference! {
```

The `!` is runtime-safe here (short-circuit evaluation), but the project-context.md explicitly bans force unwrapping: *"No force unwrapping (`!`) — no `@IBOutlet`, no implicit unwraps."* Should use optional binding or nil-coalescing:

```swift
if let best = sessionBestCentDifference {
    if diff < best { sessionBestCentDifference = diff }
} else {
    sessionBestCentDifference = diff
}
```

---

### MEDIUM ISSUES

**M1: `Localizable.xcstrings` modified but not documented in story File List**
The git diff shows `Peach/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` was modified (+8 lines — two new string catalog entries), but the story File List omits it entirely. Incomplete change documentation.

**M2: New localization strings missing German translations**
Two new entries were added to the string catalog:
- `"Current: %@ ¢"` — no German translation
- `"Session best: %@ ¢"` — no German translation

Other strings in the catalog actively maintain German translations (e.g., "Settings" → "Einstellungen", "Data" → "Daten"). These should have German equivalents (e.g., `"Aktuell: %@ ¢"`, `"Bestleistung: %@ ¢"`).

**M3: Accessibility labels are hardcoded English — not localized for German VoiceOver**
`Peach/Training/DifficultyDisplayView.swift:34-39`

The static methods return `String`, not `LocalizedStringKey`:
```swift
static func currentDifficultyAccessibilityLabel(_ value: Double) -> String {
    "Current difficulty: \(formattedDifficulty(value)) cents"
}
```

These bypass the String Catalog entirely. German VoiceOver users will hear English. Should use `String(localized:)` or pass a localized `Text` to `.accessibilityLabel()`.

**M4: `TrainingSessionDifficultyTests` struct missing `@MainActor` at struct level**
`PeachTests/Training/TrainingSessionDifficultyTests.swift:7`

The struct is *not* annotated `@MainActor` — instead, each test function and the factory method individually specify `@MainActor`. By contrast, `DifficultyDisplayViewTests` correctly has `@MainActor` on the struct. This is inconsistent with the codebase pattern and project-context.md rule: *"Every `@Test` function must be `@MainActor async`"*.

---

### LOW ISSUES

**L1: `DifficultyDisplayViewTests` functions not marked `async`**
`PeachTests/Training/DifficultyDisplayViewTests.swift` — all 6 test functions are synchronous. Project-context.md says every `@Test` function must be `@MainActor async`. These are pure synchronous tests on static methods so there's no practical risk, but it's a rule deviation.

**L2: Dev Agent Record claims "14 new unit tests" — actual count is 15**
`TrainingSessionDifficultyTests` has 9 tests (3 currentDifficulty + 6 sessionBest), `DifficultyDisplayViewTests` has 6. Total = 15, not 14. Minor documentation inaccuracy.

**L3: Untracked button refactoring scope**
The `AnswerDirection` enum and `answerButton(direction:)` refactoring in `TrainingScreen.swift` was not part of the original story tasks. Completion notes mention it was "requested by user" but it's not tracked as a task. Scope creep without documentation.

What should I do with these issues?

1. **Fix them automatically** — I'll update the code and tests
2. **Create action items** — Add to story Tasks/Subtasks for later
3. **Show me details** — Deep dive into specific issues

Choose [1], [2], or specify which issue to examine:

### 🧑 Human (18:14:41)

1

### 🤖 Assistant (18:15:19)

I'll fix all HIGH and MEDIUM issues. Let me start.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:15:40)

**H1: Replacing force unwrap with optional binding.**

### 🤖 Assistant (18:18:08)

Those diagnostics are just SourceKit noise (cross-file type references) — not related to my edit. Let me continue with M1.

**M1: Adding `Localizable.xcstrings` to story File List.**

### 🤖 Assistant (18:18:17)

**M2+M3: Fixing localization.** Let me read the xcstrings file to understand the format for German translations.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:18:33)

Now I understand the xcstrings format. Let me fix M2 (German display translations) and M3 (localized accessibility labels).

First, update the display string entries with German translations:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:18:44)

Now update `DifficultyDisplayView` to use localized `Text` for accessibility labels:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:19:02)

**M4: Adding `@MainActor` to test struct and removing individual annotations.**

### 🤖 Assistant (18:19:08)

Now remove the individual `@MainActor` annotations from each test function (they're inherited from the struct):

### 🤖 Assistant (18:19:11)

Now I need to remove the redundant `@MainActor` from each test function:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:19:49)

**Step 5: Update story Dev Agent Record and run full test suite.**

First, update the story file with review notes and change log:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:19:56)

Now run the full test suite:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:24:36)

All tests pass. Let me also check for any failing tests in the output:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:25:32)

**TEST SUCCEEDED** — 294 tests passed, 0 failures. No regressions.

Now let me determine the story status. Let me check: are all HIGH and MEDIUM issues fixed, and are all ACs implemented?

### 🤖 Assistant (18:25:36)

Now let me check for sprint tracking and update story status.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:25:45)

Now update the story status from `review` to `done`:

### 🤖 Assistant (18:25:58)

## Review Complete!

**Story Status:** done
**Issues Fixed:** 5 (1 High, 4 Medium)
**Action Items Created:** 0

**Fixes applied:**

| ID | Severity | Fix |
|----|----------|-----|
| H1 | HIGH | Replaced force unwrap `sessionBestCentDifference!` with optional binding in `TrainingSession.swift:260-265` |
| M1 | MEDIUM | Added `Localizable.xcstrings` to story File List |
| M2 | MEDIUM | Added German translations for `"Current: %@ ¢"` → `"Aktuell: %@ ¢"` and `"Session best: %@ ¢"` → `"Bestleistung: %@ ¢"` |
| M3 | MEDIUM | Changed accessibility labels from hardcoded `String` to localized `Text(...)`, added `"Current difficulty: %@ cents"` / `"Session best: %@ cents"` with German translations to string catalog |
| M4 | MEDIUM | Moved `@MainActor` to struct level on `TrainingSessionDifficultyTests`, removed redundant per-function annotations |

**Remaining LOW issues (not auto-fixed):**
- L1: `DifficultyDisplayViewTests` functions not marked `async`
- L2: Dev Agent Record says 14 tests, actual count is 15
- L3: Untracked button refactoring scope

**Test suite:** 294 tests passed, 0 failures — **TEST SUCCEEDED**

**Sprint status:** Story file updated, but sprint-status sync skipped: `display-current-difficulty-on-training-screen` not found in `sprint-status.yaml` (standalone story outside epic numbering).

### 🧑 Human (18:29:47)

commit this

### 🤖 Assistant (18:29:55)

All changes look correct. 5 files modified, all review fixes — no secrets, no unrelated changes.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:30:02)

Committed as `df10878` on `main`. Working tree is clean. Not pushed to remote (1 commit ahead of origin).

### 🧑 Human (18:30:44)

We need some way to indicate that this task from futue-work.md was completed.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:30:47)

Let me check the future-work.md to see how this task is tracked there.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:30:55)

The existing pattern for resolved items is strikethrough + `(RESOLVED)` with a status and resolution note — see lines 67 and 72. I'll apply the same pattern.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:31:08)

Now let me commit this.

### 🤖 Assistant (18:31:17)

Done. Committed as `4d8fb0e`. The future-work entry now follows the same strikethrough + `(RESOLVED)` pattern used by the other resolved items.
